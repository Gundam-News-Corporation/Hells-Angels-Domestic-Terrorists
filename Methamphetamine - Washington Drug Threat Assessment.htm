      <p align="left">Methamphetamine is a primary drug threat to Washington.
      High purity, low cost methamphetamine is readily available, and the drug
      is abused throughout the state. Methamphetamine production in Washington
      has increased, as has the number of methamphetamine laboratories seized by
      law enforcement officials. Methamphetamine production is causing serious
      safety and environmental concerns in Washington. Further, the production,
      distribution, and abuse of methamphetamine are more commonly associated
      with violent crime than any other drug. Methamphetamine is produced in
      Washington primarily by Caucasian criminal groups and local independents,
      often in ounce quantities using the Birch reduction method. Local
      independent producers, however, have produced pound quantities using the
      hydriodic acid/red phosphorus production method. Mexican criminal groups
      also produce methamphetamine in the state, sometimes in pound quantities
      typically using the hydriodic acid/red phosphorus method. Methamphetamine
      produced by Mexican criminal groups in high volume laboratories in Mexico
      and California and, to a lesser extent, in Oregon and southwestern states,
      is readily available in the state as well. Mexican criminal groups are the
      dominant transporters and wholesale distributors of methamphetamine in
      Washington. Caucasian criminal groups and local independent
      dealers--primarily Caucasian and Mexican--are the principal retail
      distributors of methamphetamine in the state.
      <h3 align="left"><font color="#800000"><a name="Abuse">Abuse</a></font></h3>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine abuse is widespread and increasing in
Washington. In FY2002 law enforcement officials in Aberdeen, Blaine, Burlington,
Hoquiam, Long Beach, Montesano, Pasco, Raymond, South Bend, and Westport
reported that methamphetamine abuse was increasing significantly in their
jurisdictions and that Caucasians were the primary abusers. Moreover, 45 of the
53 state and local law enforcement agencies that responded to the National Drug
Intelligence Center (NDIC) National Drug Threat Survey 2002 (see <a href="#NDIC"> text
box</a>)
reported that rates of methamphetamine abuse were high in their jurisdictions,
six reported medium rates of abuse, and two reported low rates of abuse.</p>

              <blockquote>
<p align="left">The National Drug Threat Survey (NDTS) 2002 was administered by
NDIC to a representative sample of state and local law enforcement agencies
throughout the United States to assess the availability, abuse, and overall
threat posed by all major drugs. NDIC received 2,906 survey responses from law
enforcement agencies, an overall response rate of 80 percent. Survey respondents
were asked to rank the greatest drug threats in their areas and to indicate the
level of availability for each major drug type. They also were asked to provide
information on specific groups involved in the transportation and distribution
of illicit drugs. Responding agencies also provided narrative assessments of
various aspects of the overall drug situation and the threat posed by specific
drugs in their areas. Survey responses are used by NDIC to substantiate and
augment drug threat information obtained from other federal, state, and local
law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p align="left">Methamphetamine-related treatment admissions in Washington have
increased. According to the Washington Division of Alcohol and Substance Abuse,
the number of treatment admissions for methamphetamine abuse to publicly funded
facilities increased overall from 980 in SFY1994 to 5,700 in SFY2001. Admission
rates per 100,000 population increased from 18 to 95.4 over the same period. The
number of treatment admissions for methamphetamine abuse was higher than any
other drug in SFY2000, according to state substance abuse data. According to the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS),
the number of methamphetamine-related treatment admissions to publicly funded
facilities in Washington increased from 4,146 in 1997 to 8,155 in 2001.
(Disparities between state and federal reporting regarding admissions to
substance abuse treatment programs are likely a result of differences in data
collection and reporting methodologies.)</p>
<p align="left">The number of emergency department (ED) mentions for
methamphetamine abuse in the Seattle metropolitan area decreased from 1997
through 2001. According to Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) data, the number of
methamphetamine-related ED mentions decreased from 479 in 1997 to 394 in 2001.
The Seattle metropolitan area ranked fifth in the number of
methamphetamine-related ED mentions per 100,000 population among the 21
metropolitan areas reporting to DAWN in 2001.</p>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine-related deaths in the Seattle metropolitan area
increased significantly from 1996 through 1999, then decreased in 2000.
According to DAWN mortality data, methamphetamine was a factor in a total of 11
deaths from 1996 through 1998. Thereafter, methamphetamine was cited in 30
drug-related deaths in the Seattle metropolitan area in 1999 and 15 drug-related
deaths in 2000.</p>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine was abused by a significant percentage of adult
male arrestees in Spokane and Seattle in 2000. According to the Arrestee Drug
Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) Program, in 2001, 20.1 percent of adult male arrestees
tested positive for methamphetamine use in Spokane, and 11.5 percent tested
positive in Seattle.</p>
<p align="left">In 1999 the percentage of Seattle high school students who
reported having abused methamphetamine at least once in their lifetime was
statistically comparable to the national percentage. According to responses to
the 1999 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), 6.7 percent of high school students
in Seattle reported that they had used methamphetamine at least once in their
lifetime compared with 9.1 percent nationally. In addition, 6.9 percent of
female high school students in Seattle reported using the drug at least once in
their lifetime. This was slightly higher than the percentage of males (6.0%).</p>

      <font color="#800000"><a name="Availability">Availability</a></font></h3>
      <p align="left">Methamphetamine is readily available throughout
      Washington. Most Washington respondents (45 of 52) to the NDTS 2002
      reported that methamphetamine was readily available in their
      jurisdictions. Moreover, the DEA Seattle Division reported that the drug
      was readily available throughout Washington in FY2001, and the DEA Yakima
      Resident Office reported that methamphetamine was readily available in
      ounce to multipound quantities in the Yakima Valley area during the same
      year. Methamphetamine produced in Washington as well as Mexico, Oregon,
      California, and southwestern states is available throughout the state;
      however, no particular type dominates. Crystal methamphetamine, a highly
      pure form of the drug known as ice, is also available, primarily in the
      Seattle-Tacoma area.</p>
      <p align="left">Seizure data also indicate that methamphetamine is readily
      available in Washington. According to respondents to the 2002 Northwest
      High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) Threat Assessment Survey,
      state and local law enforcement officials in Washington seized 60
      kilograms of methamphetamine in FY1998, 145 kilograms in FY1999, 282
      kilograms in FY2000, and 114 kilograms in FY2001. In addition, federal law
      enforcement officials in Washington seized 46 kilograms of methamphetamine
      in 1998, 48 kilograms in 1999, 58 kilograms in 2000, and 46 kilograms in
      2001, according to the Federal-wide Drug Seizure System (FDSS).</p>
      <p align="left">The percentage of federal drug sentences that were
      methamphetamine-related in Washington was higher than the national
      percentage in FY2001. According to USSC data, 31.5 percent of federal drug
      sentences in Washington in FY2001 were methamphetamine-related compared
      with 14.2 percent nationally. In addition, the number of
      methamphetamine-related federal sentences increased each year from 34 in
      FY1997 to 106 in FY2001.</p>
      <p align="left">In 2002 the price of methamphetamine in Washington varied
      depending on the area and level of distribution. The DEA Seattle Division
      reported that wholesale quantities of methamphetamine sold for $5,500 to
      $5,700 per pound in Blaine, $3,000 to $5,000 in Seattle, $4,000 to $9,000
      in Spokane, $3,000 to $10,000 in Tacoma, and $3,500 to $10,000 in Yakima.
      Retail prices of methamphetamine also varied throughout the state.
      Methamphetamine sold for $500 to $800 per ounce in Blaine, $350 to $800 in
      Seattle, $550 to $750 in Spokane, $420 to $700 in Tacoma, and $300 to $600
      in Yakima in 2002. The drug sold for $30 to $80 per gram in Blaine, $20 to
      $60 in Seattle, $40 in Spokane, $75 to $80 in Tacoma, and $40 in Yakima in
      2002.</p>
      <p align="left">The purity of methamphetamine varies in Washington. Law
      enforcement agencies in Washington reported that the purity of
      methamphetamine ranged from as low as 14 to as high as 46 percent during
      2002. According to the Northwest HIDTA, in 2002 the average purity of
      methamphetamine produced in Washington using the Birch reduction method
      was 95 percent compared with an average purity of 75 percent using the
      hydriodic acid/red phosphorus method. In Seattle the purity of retail
      quantities of crystal methamphetamine varied during 2002 but was reported
      as high as 99 percent.</p>

<p align="left">Methamphetamine-related violence is a significant problem in
Washington. The production, distribution, and abuse of methamphetamine are more
commonly associated with violent crime than any other drug, and law enforcement
agencies throughout the state report that violence associated with
methamphetamine production, distribution, and abuse poses a significant threat
to their jurisdictions. Moreover, distributors throughout the state have
committed violent crimes to protect their operations.</p>

<p align="left">In June 2002 King County Sheriff's Department officers arrested
two individuals in Maple Valley for producing methamphetamine. Another
individual arrived at the scene after the arrests were made and began shooting
at the law enforcement officers, wounding three detectives. The individual was

<p align="left">Methamphetamine is a powerful stimulant that affects the central
nervous system and can induce anxiety, insomnia, paranoia, hallucinations, mood
swings, delusions, and violent behavior, particularly during the
&quot;tweaking&quot; stage of abuse. Methamphetamine abusers have committed
violent crimes to obtain money to purchase the drug.</p>

<p align="left">As the euphoric effects of methamphetamine diminish, abusers
enter the tweaking stage in which they are prone to violence, delusions,
paranoia, and feelings of emptiness and dysphoria. During the tweaking stage the
user often has not slept in days and consequently is extremely irritable. The
&quot;tweaker&quot; also craves more methamphetamine, which results in
frustration and contributes to anxiety and restlessness. In this stage, the
methamphetamine user does not need a confrontation or provocation to become
violent. Case histories indicate that tweakers have reacted negatively at the
mere sight of a police uniform.</p>

<p align="left">OMGs known to distribute methamphetamine have committed violent
crimes in Washington. In June 2000 a member of the Iron Horsemen OMG fatally
shot a Bandidos OMG member in Yakima in a drug dispute. According to law
enforcement officials in Yakima, both OMGs were involved in methamphetamine
distribution. In Lakewood the Bandidos, Gypsy Jokers, and Iron Horsemen OMGs
have distributed methamphetamine and committed violent crimes, including assault
and homicide. The Hells Angels and Bandidos OMGs have been involved in
methamphetamine distribution and violent crimes in Spokane.</p>

<p align="left">Numerous street gangs that distribute methamphetamine also have
committed violent crimes in Washington. According to responses to the NDIC
National Gang Survey 2000, street gangs involved in methamphetamine distribution
in Washington include the Varrio Sureño Locos and Puro Mexicano Locos in
Bellevue, Young Krew Piru in Longview, Insane Gangster Crips in Spokane, Maniac
Gangster Crips in Thurston County, Norteños and Sureños in Vancouver, West
Side 18th Street in Walla Walla, and West Side Hustlaz in Yakima. Violent crimes
committed by these gangs include assault, drive-by shooting, home invasion,
homicide, and robbery.</p>

      <a name="Production"><font color="#800000">Production</font></a></h3>


<p align="left">Methamphetamine production is increasing throughout Washington.
According to the Northwest HIDTA, federal, state, and local law enforcement
officials in Washington seized 308 methamphetamine laboratories in 1998, 525 in
1999, 831 in 2000, and 939 in 2001. Moreover, according to the EPIC Clandestine
Laboratory Database, 1,043 methamphetamine-related events were reported for
Washington in 2002. A methamphetamine-related event includes laboratories and
equipment seized and dumpsites encountered. The state ranked third behind
California (1,481) and Missouri (1,094).</p>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine laboratories in Washington often are established
in apartments, garages, motel rooms, and private residences as well as in mobile
conveyances including stolen vehicles. Methamphetamine laboratories increasingly
are being established on public lands such as national parks and national and
state forests. The number of methamphetamine laboratory sites discovered by
State Department of Natural Resources (DNR) officers on state trust lands
increased from 10 in 1998 to 36 in 2000. In April 2001 the DNR in conjunction
with the Washington State Patrol discovered a methamphetamine laboratory in the
Tahoma State Forest near Mount Rainier National Park. The DNR reported that this
methamphetamine production site was the second largest ever found on state trust
lands--the laboratory equipment, precursor chemicals, and toxic waste were
spread over 2 acres. State officials closed the 26,000-acre preserve for 6 weeks
for cleanup operations.</p>
<p align="left">Caucasian criminal groups and local independent operators--often
using the Birch reduction method--are the primary producers of methamphetamine
in Washington. Mexican criminal groups and local independent operators produce
methamphetamine using the hydriodic acid/red phosphorus method. They also use
the iodine/red phosphorus method, but to a lesser extent.</p>

<p align="left">Most of the laboratories seized in Washington have been small,
capable of producing only 1 to 2 ounces of methamphetamine per cook. However,
larger laboratories capable of producing pound quantities of methamphetamine
also have been seized in the state, particularly in the Yakima and Tri-City
areas. For instance, larger methamphetamine laboratories--operated by Mexican
criminal groups and capable of producing multipound quantities of
methamphetamine--have been seized in the Tri-City area. In May 2001 law
enforcement officials in Whitstran (in Benton County near the Tri-City area)
seized and dismantled a methamphetamine laboratory and seized 34 pounds of the
drug packaged in 34 one-gallon plastic storage bags. This methamphetamine
laboratory seizure was the largest ever in Benton County and resulted from the
concerted effort of several law enforcement agencies. The Benton County
Sheriff's Department, Tri-City Metro Drug Task Force (Pasco), Law Enforcement
Against Drugs Task Force (Zillah), and Washington State Patrol's Incident
Response Team all participated in the investigation of the laboratory site and
resulting seizure.</p>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine production poses serious safety and
environmental concerns to Washington. The production process creates toxic and
hazardous waste that endangers law enforcement personnel, emergency response
teams, children (particularly those who reside in the homes of methamphetamine
producers), and the environment.</p>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine production often occurs in Washington homes,
posing a direct threat to the safety of children and adults. Because of the
presence of caustic and flammable chemicals used in methamphetamine production,
methamphetamine laboratories in homes typically result in deplorable conditions
that render the home unsafe for its residents. In 2001 the state's Child
Protective Services took into custody 228 children who were living in residences
with methamphetamine laboratories. The average age of the children was 8 years.</p>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine laboratories may contain a variety of highly
flammable chemicals and produce 5 to 7 pounds of toxic waste for every pound of
methamphetamine. Most of the toxic residue from methamphetamine production is
dumped in the local area, often contaminating groundwater and killing
vegetation. Cleanup of seized laboratories is costly and difficult because of
the hazardous chemicals used in production, and chemical contamination often is
detected at laboratory sites 2 years after methamphetamine production has ended.</p>
<p align="left">The number of methamphetamine-related cleanup operations has
increased in Washington. The Washington State Department of Ecology (DOE)
reported cleanup operations at 789 laboratories and dumpsites in 1999, 1,449 in
2000, 1,886 in 2001, and 1,568 in 2002. Nearly one-half of the cleanup
operations in 2001 were in three counties in western Washington: Pierce (407),
King (223), and Thurston (111). Pierce County had the most cleanup operations of
any county in the state during 2002.</p>
<p align="left">Many chemicals can be purchased legally in Washington, and
precursors frequently are stolen. Lithium often is extracted from batteries sold
at many retail stores, and iodine often is purchased at local feed stores.
Anhydrous ammonia is purchased by laboratory operators from agricultural supply
stores and marinas. Thefts of anhydrous ammonia also have occurred from farms
and farm supply stores across the state, especially in eastern Washington. The
Walla Walla County Sheriff's Department reported at least 25 thefts of anhydrous
ammonia during 2000. Ephedrine or pseudoephedrine is commonly extracted from
cold pills by laboratory operators. In July 2001 the Washington State
Legislature implemented a law restricting the sale of products containing
ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine. However, illegal sales
continue. In December 2001 two Tri-City convenience store owners--one in
Kennewick and another in Richland--were cited for the illegal sale of a product
containing ephedrine. The store owners allegedly sold bulk quantities of cold
medicine containing the drug. Tri-City Metro Drug Task Force officers purchased
a total of 60 bottles of decongestant from the stores in a series of undercover
transactions. Precursor and other essential chemicals also are smuggled into the
state from Canada and other states.</p>

<p align="left">Anhydrous ammonia commonly is used by farmers as a fertilizer.
Anhydrous ammonia typically is stored as a pressurized liquid in large tanks on
farm fields. Methamphetamine laboratory operators often divert the chemical from
these tanks by using garden or vacuum hoses to siphon the chemical into open
containers or empty propane cylinders. Anhydrous ammonia also is stolen from
agricultural supply stores. Thefts from farms and agricultural supply stores
have become so frequent in some agricultural areas of the country that security
measures increasingly are being employed, including alarms, surveillance
cameras, barricades, fencing, motion detectors, and special locks on tank
valves.</p>

      <p align="left">Methamphetamine is transported into Washington primarily
      from California. Methamphetamine also is transported into the state from
      Mexico, Oregon, and southwestern states, but to a lesser extent. Mexican
      criminal groups are the primary transporters of methamphetamine into the
      state. Caucasian criminal groups, OMGs, and Caucasian and Mexican local
      independent dealers also transport methamphetamine into and throughout the
      state.</p>
      <p align="left">Methamphetamine typically is transported into Washington
      in private vehicles on I-5 and I-82, as well as US 97. Methamphetamine
      also is transported into the state on passenger trains, commercial
      vehicles, commercial and private maritime vessels, commercial and private
      aircraft, buses, and via package delivery services. During a routine
      traffic stop in April 2000, the California Highway Patrol (CHP) seized
      more than 3 pounds of methamphetamine concealed inside a false compartment
      of a private vehicle driven by a Mexican national en route to Tacoma on
      I-5. In February 2000 CHP officers seized nearly 11 pounds of the drug
      from a Caucasian male in a rental vehicle en route to Washington on
      I-505--a north-south route that connects I-5 and I-80. The drug was sealed
      in plastic, covered with baby wipes, and concealed in a backpack. In
      addition, in January 2000 state and local law enforcement officials in
      Seattle under Operation Jetway seized more than 5 pounds of
      methamphetamine from a package mailed from Los Angeles and destined for
      Everett.</p>

                In the spring of 2002, United States Customs Service (USCS)
                agents seized 136 pounds of pharmaceutical grade ephedrine from
                a white male subject who kayaked to Gooseberry Point in Birch
                Bay. The subject traveled by ferry to San Juan Island, then
                kayaked from the Island to the Point where he met up with a
                female who had driven a van to the beach pickup point. Upon
                interviewing the subjects, the agents were told that they had
                made three trips like this with similar amounts of ephedrine.
                The male subject also stated that he had taken five loads of
                cocaine into Canada the same way. He also advised that he had
                smuggled pill presses into Canada by kayak.</p>

<p align="left">Methamphetamine also is transported from Washington to other
states and Canada. Law enforcement officials in Washington and other states
report that multipound quantities of the drug are transported from Yakima and,
to a lesser extent, Spokane and the Tri-City area to Idaho, Illinois, Minnesota,
Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Canada. Methamphetamine most commonly is
transported from Washington in private vehicles along I-5 and I-90 and US 2 and
US 97. In April 2002 the South Dakota Highway Patrol seized 18 pounds of
methamphetamine and arrested four Mexican nationals who were transporting the
drug from Pasco to Illinois via I-90. The methamphetamine was concealed in
hidden compartments in each of the rear doors of the vehicle. In September 2000
the Montana Highway Patrol seized more than 1.5 pounds of methamphetamine and
arrested an illegal Mexican national male who was transporting the drug from
Washington to Bismarck, North Dakota, on I-90. The methamphetamine was concealed
in the speakers of the automobile.</p>

      <p align="left">Mexican criminal groups are the primary wholesale
      distributors of methamphetamine produced outside the state. Mexican
      independent dealers also distribute wholesale quantities of
      methamphetamine in the state, but to a lesser extent. Law enforcement
      officials in Spokane and Yakima report that Mexican independent dealers
      are the primary methamphetamine wholesale distributors in those cities.
      Caucasian criminal groups and local independent dealers are the primary
      wholesale distributors of methamphetamine produced in Washington.</p>
      <p align="left">Caucasian criminal groups as well as Caucasian and Mexican
      local independent dealers are the principal retail distributors of
      methamphetamine in Washington. Street gangs, primarily African American
      and Mexican, and OMGs also distribute the drug at the retail level. Law
      enforcement officials responding to the NDIC National Gang Survey 2000
      reported that numerous street gangs distribute methamphetamine at the
      retail level in the state. These gangs include Varrio Sureño Locos and
      Puro Mexicano Locos in Bellevue, Young Krew Piru in Longview, Insane
      Gangster Crips in Spokane, Maniac Gangster Crips in Thurston County,
      Norteños and Sureños in Vancouver, West Side 18th Street in Walla Walla,
      and West Side Hustlaz in Yakima. The Bandidos, Gypsy Jokers, and Iron
      Horsemen OMGs in Lakewood and the Bandidos and Hells Angels OMGs in
      Spokane also serve as retail level methamphetamine distributors.</p>
      <p align="left">Methamphetamine packaging varies depending on the amount
      distributed. Wholesale quantities of methamphetamine are often packaged in
      large plastic storage bags for distribution, while retail quantities often
      are packaged in small plastic bags, cellophane, and wallet-size tins.</p>

      <p>Methamphetamine is the most significant drug threat to North Dakota and
      is the drug-related investigative priority for federal, state, and local
      law enforcement officials. Treatment admissions to publicly funded
      facilities for methamphetamine abuse from 1994 through 1999 surpassed
      admissions for abuse of any other illicit drug except marijuana.
      Methamphetamine is readily available, and its availability is increasing
      throughout the state. Law enforcement officials seized more
      methamphetamine statewide in 1999 than during the previous 4 years
      combined. They report that Mexico-produced methamphetamine is the most
      common type available, followed by methamphetamine produced in California
      by Mexican criminal groups. High purity methamphetamine produced in small
      quantities in North Dakota is also of great concern. The number of
      methamphetamine laboratory seizures has increased since 1998. Mexican
      criminal groups transport multipound quantities of the drug from Mexico
      and California via Minnesota and Washington and distribute the drug at the
      wholesale level. Caucasian and Native American local independent dealers
      are the primary retail distributors of Mexico- and California-produced
      methamphetamine. Independent methamphetamine producers, primarily
      Caucasians, are the retail distributors of locally produced
      methamphetamine. In addition, the Sons of Silence outlaw motorcycle gang (OMG)
      transports small amounts of methamphetamine, primarily from transshipment
      points in Colorado, and distributes the drug at the retail level in North
      Dakota.
      <h3><font color="#800000"><a name="Abuse">Abuse</a></font></h3>
      <p>Methamphetamine abuse is a serious problem in North Dakota. However,
      federal abuse statistics indicate that methamphetamine treatment
      admissions may be decreasing. TEDS data indicate that methamphetamine
      treatment admissions to publicly funded facilities increased from 23 in
      1994 to 95 in 1997, then decreased to 69 in 1999. (See <a href="#Table 1"> Table
      1</a>.)
      Nevertheless, North Dakota health officials report that there were more
      methamphetamine treatment admissions between 1994 and 2000 than for any
      other illicit drug except marijuana. In North Dakota in 1999 males
      composed 62.3 percent of treatment admissions. In the same year 94.2
      percent of treatment admissions were Caucasian, and 5.8 percent were
      Native American/Alaska Native. The age groups with the highest percentage
      of users--ages 18 to 20 and 31 to 35--each accounted for 23.2 percent of
      methamphetamine treatment admissions. According to the NDIC National Drug
      Threat Survey 2001, officials from the Bismarck Police Department reported
      an increasing number of methamphetamine overdoses in their jurisdiction.

      <p>Methamphetamine abuse among North Dakota youth is a concern. According
      to the 1999 North Dakota Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS),
      methamphetamine abuse among high school students in North Dakota is above
      the national average. Nearly 11 percent of high school students in North
      Dakota reported lifetime methamphetamine use compared with slightly more
      than 9 percent nationally.</p>

      <h3>
      <font color="#800000"><a name="Availability">Availability</a></font></h3>
      <p>Methamphetamine availability is reportedly increasing throughout North
      Dakota. Methamphetamine produced in Mexico is the most prevalent type
      available in North Dakota, followed by methamphetamine produced in
      California by Mexican criminal groups. The amount of methamphetamine
      seized by the Mandan Police Department increased dramatically from 14.2
      grams in 1993 to 3,402 grams in 2000. Methamphetamine-related
      investigations increased throughout North Dakota from 48 in 1995 to 119 in
      1999. Arrests increased from 24 in 1995 to 116 in 1999. According to the
      U.S. Sentencing Commission, methamphetamine-related federal sentences in
      North Dakota increased overall from 10 in 1995 to 25 in 2000; nationally,
      sentences increased overall from 1,167 in 1995 to 3,397 in 2000.</p>
      <p>Increases in the number of methamphetamine samples submitted to the
      North Dakota Crime Laboratory may further indicate increasing
      availability. The North Dakota Crime Laboratory reported an overall
      increase of methamphetamine samples submitted for analysis from 1992
      through 2000--14 samples in 1992, 65 in 1993, 494 in 1999, and 1,218 in
      2000.</p>
      <p>Methamphetamine prices in North Dakota are decreasing, possibly
      indicating an increase in availability. Prices in FY1999 ranged from $125
      to $200 per gram and $2,000 to $2,500 per ounce, while in FY2000, prices
      ranged from $100 to $120 per gram and $1,000 to $1,300 per ounce.</p>

      <h3>
      <font color="#800000"><a name="Violence">Violence</a></font></h3>
      <p>In North Dakota methamphetamine-related violence poses a threat to the
      safety of the population. Methamphetamine abusers can be violent and can
      endanger themselves and those around them, especially during the tweaking
      stage. Tweaking occurs at the end of a binge when nothing, not even
      additional methamphetamine, will relieve the abuser's feelings of
      emptiness and dysphoria. The tweaking stage is very uncomfortable for
      abusers, who often take depressants to ease the unpleasant feelings.
      Tweakers often are irritable and prone to unpredictable behavior. In 1996
      a Fargo man under the influence of methamphetamine set his house on fire
      because he believed that the police had installed surveillance equipment
      in it. In May 2000 another methamphetamine abuser ripped the drywall off
      the entire inside of his house and kicked in his television set because he
      believed that police had invaded the house through the sewer and had
      installed listening devices in his walls and television set.</p>
      <p>The potential for violence associated with methamphetamine production
      in North Dakota is significant. Methamphetamine producers go to great
      lengths to prevent discovery of laboratory sites, often endangering the
      lives of others including law enforcement personnel. In April 2000
      Burleigh County law enforcement officials arrested a 17-year-old male for
      producing methamphetamine and allegedly threatening to kill coworkers if
      they disclosed the location of his laboratory. Three other individuals,
      ranging in age from 18 to 20, also were arrested in connection with the
      laboratory. The 20-year-old possessed a weapon and had a prior criminal
      record for methamphetamine distribution.

      production.

      <p>Methamphetamine production in North Dakota is low but increasing.
      Seizures of methamphetamine laboratories in North Dakota increased overall
      from 5 in 1998 to 46 in 2000, and preliminary 2001 reporting indicates
      that seizures are likely to increase again. Of the 46 laboratories seized
      in 2000 by the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI), 22
      were located in rural areas, 17 were in urban areas, and 7 were in small
      towns. All North Dakota respondents to the NDIC National Drug Threat
      Survey 2001 reported increases in laboratory seizures. During the second
      quarter of 2001, 19 laboratories were seized state-wide in North Dakota
      compared with 9 during the same period in 2000. Officers from the
      Northwest Narcotics Task Force--encompassing Divide, Williams, and
      McKenzie Counties located along the state's northwestern border with
      Montana--typically seize 4 laboratories per year; however, by June 2001
      the task force had seized 12.

      containers (thermos jugs, soda containers, and large plastic cups),
      kitchen utensils (spatulas, stirrers, plastic bowls), and other household
      items. The precursor chemical pseudoephedrine may be obtained from
      products purchased over the counter at any convenience store or pharmacy.
      A second precursor chemical, anhydrous ammonia, often is stolen from
      agricultural suppliers or from storage tanks in farm fields. Other
      essential chemicals used in methamphetamine production are found in
      products such as starter fluid, denatured alcohol, drain cleaner, lye, and
      lithium batteries, which are available at local hardware and discount
      stores. Often laboratory operators purchase these products in small
      quantities to avoid arousing suspicion. Officials from the Bismarck Police
      Department report increasing thefts of over-the-counter medications and
      chemicals used in methamphetamine production.</p>
      <p align="left">North Dakota law enforcement officials also are concerned with
      increasing thefts of precursor chemicals throughout the state. Officials
      from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Fargo Resident Office
      report that thefts of anhydrous ammonia increased significantly during
      2000 and 2001. Officials report that during the week of November 12, 2001,
      they seized six Birch reduction method laboratories--all were seized along
      with stolen anhydrous ammonia containers. In the fall of 1999 Cavalier
      County law enforcement officials arrested an Idaho woman in possession of
      equipment commonly used to steal anhydrous ammonia. According to the
      Cavalier County sheriff, the woman said that she was &quot;in heaven&quot;
      with all the anhydrous ammonia tanks and if producers knew of the ready
      availability of the chemical, more would come to North Dakota. The woman's
      arrest led officials from the Cavalier County Sheriff's Department to a
      methamphetamine laboratory in the small town of Hansboro on the
      U.S.-Canada border. In addition, North Dakota BCI officers have documented
      eight instances in which individuals traveled from Minnesota to steal
      anhydrous ammonia to use in methamphetamine production in that state.</p>
      <p align="left">North Dakota's proximity to Canada provides advantages for local
      laboratory operators and challenges to law enforcement authorities.
      Intelligence reports indicate that chemicals used to produce
      methamphetamine are likely transported into North Dakota from Canada.
      Precursor chemicals such as ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and P2P are more
      readily available, less expensive, and regulated less restrictively in
      Canada than in the United States. Burke County Sheriff's Department
      officers report that there has been an influx of individuals with criminal
      records for methamphetamine production from California and other western
      states. These individuals are suspected of smuggling precursor chemicals
      across the U.S.-Canada border and producing methamphetamine in North
      Dakota.</p>
      <p align="left">Methamphetamine laboratories pose hazards to local residents, law
      enforcement officers, and other emergency response personnel. These
      laboratories contain highly flammable, toxic chemicals and vapors.
      Methamphetamine laboratories produce 5 to 7 pounds of toxic waste for
      every pound of methamphetamine produced. Toxic residue from
      methamphetamine production is dumped in the local area, contaminating
      groundwater and soil. Remediation of these laboratory sites costs federal,
      state, and local governments thousands of dollars every year. The national
      average cost of cleaning one site is $5,000; however, costs can exceed
      $100,000 for larger sites.</p>

      <p align="left">Mexican criminal groups transport multipound quantities of
      methamphetamine into North Dakota. Officials from the North Dakota BCI and
      the DEA Fargo Resident Office report that these groups are the primary
      transporters of methamphetamine into North Dakota from source areas in
      Mexico as well as California. Minnesota and Washington are distribution
      centers for methamphetamine transported to North Dakota. The Office of the
      State's Attorney and law enforcement officials in Fargo and Grand Forks
      agree that Mexican criminal groups are responsible for most of the
      Mexico-produced methamphetamine transported into their jurisdictions.

      <p align="left">Bismarck Police officers report that some Mexican males--most of whom
      are in the United States illegally--transport an estimated 15 to 20 pounds
      of methamphetamine into their jurisdiction every 2 weeks via private
      vehicles licensed in California or Washington. Some of this
      methamphetamine likely is distributed throughout the state.</p>
      <p align="left">In 2000 an Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF)
      investigation targeted a Mexican criminal group that used private vehicles
      to transport methamphetamine into the Fargo/Moorhead area. In July 2001
      Grand Forks Area Narcotics Task Force officers seized 10 pounds of
      methamphetamine hidden in the gas tank of a private vehicle. Three Mexican
      males who were arrested in association with the seizure had transported
      the methamphetamine from Minneapolis, Minnesota, into Grand Forks.</p>
      <p align="left">Mexican criminal groups primarily use Interstates 29 and 94 to
      transport methamphetamine into the state. Interstate 29 connects the
      eastern cities in North Dakota to Sioux City, Iowa, and Omaha, Nebraska,
      which are methamphetamine distribution centers for the region, according
      to the Midwest High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. Interstate 94 links
      North Dakota with interstates that extend to California, Minnesota, and
      Washington as well as Denver, Colorado. These groups also use US 2, 83,
      85, and 281 as secondary routes to transport methamphetamine into North
      Dakota.</p>
      <p align="left">Transporters sometimes use other modes, such as package delivery
      services, tractor-trailers, and passenger trains, to transport
      methamphetamine into North Dakota. Officials from the Stutsman County Task
      Force report that in one methamphetamine investigation, transporters
      concealed the drug in stuffed animals and mailed them via package delivery
      services from California.</p>
      <p align="left">The Sons of Silence OMG also transports small amounts of
      methamphetamine for distribution in North Dakota, primarily from chapters
      in Colorado. Members of Colorado chapters transport Mexico-produced
      methamphetamine to North Dakota chapters, or North Dakota chapter members
      transport the drug from Colorado. Sons of Silence maintains chapters in
      Bismarck, Fargo, Grand Forks, and Minot.

                Sons of Silence, with chapters in eight states, is the fifth
                largest OMG in the United States; total membership is estimated
                to be between 200 and 250. Sons of Silence maintains an alliance
                with Hells Angels, primarily due to their mutual rivalry with
                the Outlaws OMG. Sons of Silence is structured much like Hells
                Angels--each chapter maintains a self-governing hierarchy, which
                typically consists of a president, vice president,
                secretary-treasurer, and sergeant at arms.</p>

      <p align="left">Mexican criminal groups transport methamphetamine and control the
      drug's wholesale distribution in North Dakota. DEA and state law
      enforcement agencies report that these groups distribute multiounce and
      larger quantities of methamphetamine in the state. When arrested, members
      of these groups are deported to Mexico, where they often obtain new
      identities and then return to the United States.</p>
      <p align="left">Caucasian and Native American local independent dealers are the primary
      retail distributors of Mexico- and California-produced methamphetamine.
      Independent methamphetamine producers, primarily Caucasians, are the
      retail distributors of locally produced methamphetamine. Officials from
      the Metro Area and Northwest Narcotics Task Forces as well as the Stutsman
      and Ward County Task Forces report that Caucasian local independent
      dealers are the primary retail methamphetamine distributors in their
      jurisdictions. Officials from the North Dakota BCI report that Native
      American local independent dealers distribute methamphetamine at the
      retail level throughout the state. Dickinson Police Department and BCI
      officers indicate that local independent producers, who produce
      methamphetamine primarily for their own personal use, also are involved in
      the retail distribution of their product.</p>
      <p align="left">Mexican criminal groups often form associations with Native Americans
      to distribute methamphetamine. North Dakota BCI officers report that
      groups of Mexican migrant workers use Indian reservations as a place of
      refuge. Once there, the Mexican group members seldom leave the
      reservations to distribute drugs; rather, they employ Native Americans to
      distribute the drugs for them. These Native Americans then distribute the
      drugs to Caucasian abusers in cities such as Bismarck, Fargo, and Grand
      Forks. Caucasian abusers also go to the reservations to purchase
      methamphetamine. An investigator with the Turtle Mountain Reservation Drug
      Task Force identified four groups of Native Americans with ties to Mexican
      criminal groups.

                County near the U.S.-Canada border, includes numerous roads and
                trails that provide easy access to the border. In May 2001 a
                methamphetamine distributor living on the Turtle Mountain
                Reservation was arrested as part of a major drug distribution
                network with connections to Montana, Oregon, South Dakota, and
                Washington. Eight individuals were arrested during the 3-year

      <p align="left">The Sons of Silence OMG also distributes methamphetamine at the retail
      level throughout North Dakota. It typically uses smaller, affiliated OMGs
      to distribute the drug at the retail level, which insulates it from law
      enforcement scrutiny, according to officials from the DEA Fargo Resident
      Office and the North Dakota BCI.</p>
      <p align="left">There are no specific locations within North Dakota cities in which to
      purchase user quantities of methamphetamine. Retail sales are arranged by
      word of mouth and take place in private residences. According to the BCI
      and the DEA Fargo Resident Office, if an individual wants to purchase user
      quantities of methamphetamine, that person must have a contact; there are
      no &quot;cold buys.&quot;</p>

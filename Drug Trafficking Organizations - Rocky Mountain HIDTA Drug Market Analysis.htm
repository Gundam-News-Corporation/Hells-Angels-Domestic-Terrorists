    <h2><font color="#800000"><a name="Start">D</a>rug Trafficking Organizations</font></h2>
    <p>Mexican DTOs and criminal groups control most of the transportation and wholesale 
    distribution of methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana in the Rocky 
    Mountain HIDTA region. They maintain connections to sources of supply--often 
    friends or family members--in Mexico, California, Washington, and the Southwest 
    Border area. Mexican DTOs routinely alter their methods of operation to avoid 
    law enforcement detection during the course of their drug trafficking activities. 
    They often compartmentalize drug and bulk currency transportation cells to limit 
    members' knowledge of the organization's activities and to avoid collocation 
    of drugs and money. When arrested, Mexican DTO members offer little information 
    to law enforcement personnel because members possess limited knowledge of the 
    organization's operations. Moreover, Mexican DTO&nbsp;members easily assimilate 
    into the large Mexican population in the region and often engage in identity 
    theft and use forged documentation, further complicating efforts to identify 
    these individuals. Mexican DTOs and criminal groups also exploit tribal lands 
    in and adjacent to the Rocky Mountain HIDTA region to facilitate their illicit 
    drug operations and evade law enforcement detection.</p>
    <p>Asian DTOs and criminal groups are the primary suppliers of high-potency 
    Canadian marijuana (also known as BC Bud) and MDMA in the Rocky Mountain HIDTA 
    region. However, these DTOs are considered a much lower organizational threat 
    by law enforcement officials than are Mexican DTOs and criminal groups. Asian 
    traffickers transport wholesale quantities of BC Bud and MDMA from Canada through 
    Washington into the region for local distribution and for shipment to markets 
    outside the region, primarily in the Midwest and East. They also smuggle these 
    drugs across the U.S.-Canada border in Montana. Law enforcement officials in 
    northwestern Montana report an increase in larger marijuana shipments by Asian 
    traffickers from Canada using fixed-wing aircraft, floatplanes, and helicopters 
    to cross the border. Officials also report that some traffickers hire local 
    individuals as &quot;mules&quot; to cross the northern border in Montana between POEs 
    while carrying 50- to 100-pound quantities of BC Bud, typically in sports equipment 
    bags. These loads are often transported by private vehicles, ATVs, and snowmobiles, 
    as well as on foot. Most of the high-potency marijuana smuggled across the border 
    is transported to distribution centers such as Denver; Salt Lake City; Las Vegas, 
    Nevada; and Los Angeles and San Francisco, California.</p>
    <p>Hispanic (primarily Mexican), African American, and Asian street gangs are 
    the principal retail-level drug distributors in the Rocky Mountain HIDTA region. 
    These gangs are responsible for most of the violent crimes, including assaults, 
    home invasions, and homicides, that take place in metropolitan areas of the 
    region; most violent crime perpetrated by these street gangs relates to drug 
    operations and protection of their distribution areas. Hispanic gangs such as 
    Sureños 13 distribute methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana that they 
    receive from Mexican traffickers. African American street gangs such as Rolling 
    30's Crips are the primary converters and distributors of crack cocaine in metropolitan 
    areas of the region. Additionally, African American street gangs in Denver distribute 
    PCP (phencyclidine) that they acquire from gang associates who produce the drug 
    in Los Angeles.</p>
    <p>Members of outlaw motorcycle gangs (OMGs) such as Bandidos, Hells Angels 
    Motorcycle Club (HAMC), Outlaws, and Sons of Silence distribute methamphetamine 
    and BC Bud in some areas of the region. These OMG members obtain methamphetamine 
    from Mexican traffickers in the area and also transport the drug from California 
    and southwestern states. Members of HAMC, who smuggle significant quantities 
    of BC Bud from Canada into the United States, often cross the Northern Border 
    in British Columbia to enter Washington but more often smuggle the drug from 
    Canada directly into the HIDTA region in Montana.</p>

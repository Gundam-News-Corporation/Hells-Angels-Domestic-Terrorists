<p align="left">Methamphetamine poses an increasing drug threat to Pennsylvania,
particularly in the northwestern part of the state, despite low demand data.
According to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Drug and Alcohol Programs, there were
162 methamphetamine-related treatment admissions in both SFY2001 and SFY2002.
Bradford County had the highest rate of methamphetamine-related treatment
admissions per 10,000 population (3.19) in the state in 2002--the statewide rate
was 0.13. DAWN ED data indicate that there were 67 methamphetamine-related
mentions in the Philadelphia metropolitan area in 2000 to 60 in 2001 to 50 in
2002. The rate of methamphetamine-related ED mentions per 100,000 population in
the Philadelphia metropolitan area (1) was lower than the rate nationwide (7) in
2002. DAWN mortality data indicate that methamphetamine was a factor in 7 of the
874 drug deaths in the Philadelphia metropolitan area in 2001. Allegheny County
Coroner data indicated that methamphetamine was not a factor in any of the 210
accidental drug overdose deaths in 2002. According to ADAM Program data, no
adult male arrestees in Philadelphia tested positive for methamphetamine in
2001. The 2001 YRBS indicated that 4.6 percent of high school students surveyed
in Philadelphia reported having abused methamphetamine in their lifetime,
compared with 9.8 percent nationwide.</p>

              <blockquote>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine abuse is characterized by three patterns of
abuse: low intensity, binge, and high intensity. Low-intensity abusers usually
swallow or snort methamphetamine as an appetite suppressant or to provide extra
stimulation for work or play. Binge abusers smoke or inject methamphetamine and
experience euphoric rushes that are highly addictive. The most dangerous stage
of a binge cycle is known as tweaking. Typically, during this stage, the abuser
has not slept in several days and is irritable and experiencing feelings of
paranoia. The tweaker has an intense methamphetamine craving; however, no dosage
will re-create the euphoric high the tweaker seeks. High-intensity abusers are
the addicts often called speed freaks. Their goal is to prevent the crash
associated with coming down from a methamphetamine high, but they experience
declining euphoria each time they ingest methamphetamine due to increased
tolerance.</p>

<p align="left">The availability of methamphetamine varies from low to moderate
levels throughout Pennsylvania. Generally, methamphetamine availability is
higher in the northwestern and eastern parts of the state. According to the NDTS
2002, 77 of the 99 law enforcement respondents in Pennsylvania reported the
availability of methamphetamine as low or medium. Eight respondents (Allentown,
Bloomsburg, Dubois, Erie, Lyndora, Sayre, Wilkes-Barre, and Willow Grove)
reported that methamphetamine was available at high levels. Fourteen did not
respond to this item on the survey questionnaire. According to FDSS data,
federal law enforcement officials in Pennsylvania seized 4.7 kilograms of
methamphetamine in 2002, an increase from the 1.4 kilograms seized in 2001. USSC
data indicate that the percentage of drug-related federal sentences in
Pennsylvania that involved methamphetamine (9.7%) was lower than the national
percentage (14.2%) in FY2001. Methamphetamine sold for $8,000 to $13,000 per
pound, $700 to $2,000 per ounce, and $80 to $200 per gram in Pennsylvania and
was 25 to 60 percent pure in the second quarter of FY2003, according to the DEA
Philadelphia Division.</p>

<p align="left">Most of the methamphetamine available in Pennsylvania is
produced locally by Caucasian criminal groups and local independent dealers and
by OMGs such as Breed, Hells Angels, Pagan's, and Warlocks using the iodine/red
phosphorus, Birch reduction, and (to a lesser extent) the phenyl-2-propanone
production methods. State and local law enforcement officials report increasing
levels of methamphetamine production in Bradford, Columbia, Crawford, Erie,
Jefferson, Lawrence, McKean, and Venango Counties. Pennsylvania State Police
officials seized 32 methamphetamine laboratories in 2002 and almost that many
laboratories in the first half of 2003. Most of the laboratories seized were
capable of producing gram to ounce quantities of methamphetamine per production
cycle. Methamphetamine laboratories in Pennsylvania typically are located at
private residences and hunting cabins. Mobile methamphetamine laboratories also
are used, although to a lesser extent. Such laboratories typically are set up in
small trailers that are moved into wooded or secluded areas to run a production
cycle, and then quickly moved to another location to run another production
cycle.</p>

  <p align="left"><font color="#800000"><b>Hydriodic acid/red phosphorus</b></font>. The principal chemicals are
  ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, hydriodic acid, and red phosphorus. This method
  can yield multipound quantities of high quality d-methamphetamine and often is
  associated with Mexican DTOs and criminal groups.</p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#800000"><b>Iodine/red phosphorus</b></font>. The principal chemicals are ephedrine
  or pseudoephedrine, iodine, and red phosphorus. The required hydriodic acid in
  this variation of the hydriodic acid/ red phosphorus method is produced by the
  reaction of iodine in water with red phosphorus. This method yields high
  quality d-methamphetamine.</p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#800000"><b>Iodine/hypophosphorous acid</b></font>. The principal chemicals are
  ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, iodine, and hypophosphorous acid. The required
  hydriodic acid in this variation of the hydriodic acid/red phosphorus method
  is produced by the reaction of iodine in water with hypophosphorous acid.
  Known as the hypo method, this method yields lower quality d-methamphetamine.
  Hypophosphorous acid is more prone than red phosphorus to cause a fire and can
  produce deadly phosphine gas.</p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#800000"><b>Birch</b></font>. The principal chemicals are ephedrine or
  pseudoephedrine, anhydrous ammonia, and sodium or lithium metal. Also known as
  the Nazi method, this method typically yields ounce quantities of high quality
  d-methamphetamine and often is used by independent dealers and producers.</p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#800000"><b>Phenyl-2-propanone:</b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#800000"><b>P2P</b></font>. The principal chemicals are phenyl-2-propanone, aluminum,
  methylamine, and mercuric acid. This method yields lower quality
  dl-methamphetamine and has been associated with OMGs.</p>

<p align="left">Some of the methamphetamine available in Pennsylvania is
transported into the state from Arizona, California, and Mexico, among other
areas. Caucasian criminal groups and local independent dealers and OMGs such as
Breed, Hells Angels, Pagan's, and Warlocks are the principal transporters of
methamphetamine into Pennsylvania. These dealers, groups, and OMGs typically
transport methamphetamine to Pennsylvania via private vehicles and package
delivery services.</p>
<p align="left">Caucasian criminal groups and local independent dealers and OMGs
such as Breed, Hells Angels, Pagan's, and Warlocks are the principal
wholesale-level and retail-level distributors of methamphetamine in
Pennsylvania. However, most methamphetamine distribution in the state typically
involves gram and ounce quantities. Methamphetamine distributed at the retail
level often is packaged in folded pages of pornographic magazines, small plastic
bags, and cellophane from cigarette packs. Retail-level methamphetamine
distribution in Pennsylvania typically occurs from private residences, hotel
rooms, and bars as well as in public parking area at malls and shopping centers
and, to a lesser extent, at open-air drug markets.</p>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine-related violence occurs occasionally in
Pennsylvania. Further, state law enforcement officials report that the number of
child endangerment cases related to methamphetamine abuse and production is
increasing.</p>

      <p>San Diego is no longer considered &quot;the meth capital of the United
      States&quot; but it continues to be a center for methamphetamine activity.
      According to a 1999 Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) report, Mexican
      DTOs are responsible for approximately 80 percent of methamphetamine
      distribution nationwide. Although Mexican DTOs continue to operate
      methamphetamine superlabs in the United States, the bulk of the
      methamphetamine consumed in the United States is produced in Mexico. San
      Diego remains one of the first destinations for the large quantities
      smuggled across the Southwest Border. From 1998 to 1999, seizures
      increased 85 percent in San Diego and Imperial Counties--from 312 to 577
      kilograms. This represents 54 percent of the methamphetamine seized on the
      Southwest Border.</p>
      <p>The DEA San Diego Field Division and local law enforcement report that
      methamphetamine production, trafficking, and abuse constitute the most
      serious drug threat in Southern California. The DEA San Diego Field
      Division reports that methamphetamine is the drug of choice and is
      available in all quantities. Imperial County is experiencing an increase
      in methamphetamine activity. DEA reports that bulk seizures of the drug
      are becoming more commonplace and that some distributors prefer to sell
      this drug in lieu of cocaine.</p>
      <p>The San Diego Sheriff's Department identifies methamphetamine as a
      stable but major threat, and the Chula Vista Police Department classifies
      methamphetamine as a major and increasing threat. Drug use information
      indicates that methamphetamine use declined in the San Diego area in 1999.
      However, current anecdotal information and FY2000 data from the California
      Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs suggests that methamphetamine use
      may be increasing once again.</p>
      <p>Information from law enforcement sources at the federal, state, and
      local levels in San Diego and Imperial Counties indicates that a large
      percentage of their resources are focused on the methamphetamine problem.
      In 1999, these agencies conducted 7,307 narcotic enforcement actions in
      San Diego and Imperial Counties, 3,024 or 42 percent of which were
      methamphetamine-related, the highest of eight arrest categories that also
      include cocaine-, crack cocaine-, heroin-, marijuana-, polydrug-, other
      dangerous drug-, and money laundering-related actions. The San Diego
      County Integrated Narcotic Task Force reports that 40 percent of drug
      arrests made during the first 8 months of fiscal year (FY) 2000 were
      methamphetamine-related (114 of 285).</p>
      <p>Although most of the methamphetamine available in the district is
      smuggled across the border from Mexico, some is produced in the two-county
      area. In addition to the crime and violence associated with
      methamphetamine trafficking and abuse, there is a societal impact
      associated with the abuse and production of the drug. As a result of the
      proliferation of clandestine methamphetamine laboratories, particularly
      &quot;home labs,&quot; children, law enforcement personnel, and civilians
      are increasingly exposed to the dangers of explosions, toxic chemicals,
      and lethal by-products of the manufacturing process. In addition to the
      human risk factor, toxic by-products of the methamphetamine manufacturing
      process can contaminate groundwater, soil, and the buildings housing the
      laboratories.</p>
      <p>Children are also at risk for abuse and neglect by parents or
      caregivers addicted to the drug. San Diego is one of seven counties in
      California with a Drug Endangered Children (DEC) program. DEC coordinates
      efforts of law enforcement, the District Attorney's Office, and social
      services to respond to the plight of children exposed to toxic chemicals
      at clandestine laboratory sites. The Imperial County Narcotics Task Force
      reported that in 1999, they had several cases where children as young as 4
      months had to be removed from homes where methamphetamine was being sold.
      In one case, three children were removed from a home described as a
      &quot;pigsty&quot; because &quot;rotting food and trash were stacked 3
      feet high&quot; throughout. The children were in the care of their
      grandmother who was arrested for selling methamphetamine. The <i>San Diego
      Union-Tribune</i> reported that since 1998 the San Diego District
      Attorney's DEC program has rescued more than 200 children from homes where
      methamphetamine laboratories operated.</p>

      <p>Although methamphetamine continues to be classified as the number one
      threat in the region, methamphetamine use appears to have declined from
      previous high levels. Various drug use reports indicate that
      methamphetamine use is down in West Coast cities and areas of the
      Southwest. According to ADAM statistics, the percentage of adult arrestees
      in the San Diego area testing positive for methamphetamine dropped from 40
      percent in 1997 to about 33 percent in 1998. Juvenile arrestees testing
      positive for methamphetamine similarly declined, from 17 to 12.2 percent.</p>
      <p>In San Diego, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
      Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Drug Abuse
      Warning Network (DAWN) estimated rate of emergency department
      methamphetamine/speed mentions decreased from 30 per 100,000 in 1995 to 24
      per 100,000 in 1999. Methamphetamine overdose deaths were at the lowest
      level since at least 1992. According to the California Department of Drug
      and Alcohol Programs, treatment admissions for &quot;amphetamines&quot;
      declined slightly from 1995 to 1997 in both San Diego and Imperial
      Counties. Admissions in San Diego fell from 3,933 in 1995 to 3,783 in
      1997. Imperial County amphetamine admissions decreased from 257 in 1995 to
      192 in 1997.</p>
      <p>Between FY1998 and FY1999, methamphetamine admissions in San Diego
      County fell 2.6 percent. During the same period, Imperial County
      admissions declined 34 percent, from 186 to 122. Overall, the number of
      individuals seeking treatment for methamphetamine abuse declined in both
      counties between FY1998 and FY1999.</p>

              The latest figures from the California Department of Alcohol and
              Drug Programs indicate that methamphetamine use may be increasing
              again. The number of those seeking treatment for methamphetamine
              use in San Diego and Imperial counties rose from 4,226 in FY1999
              to 4,438 in FY2000, a 5 percent increase.<br>

      <p>More Caucasians than Hispanics sought treatment for methamphetamine
      abuse in San Diego in both fiscal years. Imperial County reports that more
      Caucasians than Hispanics sought treatment in FY1998 but in the following
      year Hispanics outnumbered Caucasians. In San Diego and Imperial Counties
      more females than males sought treatment for methamphetamine abuse in
      FY1998 and FY1999. The age of those seeking treatment ranged from under 18
      to over 55 but was most heavily concentrated in the 21- to 40-year
      bracket.</p>

      <p>According to DAWN, total drug deaths in the San Diego area increased
      yearly between 1995 and 1997 when the number of deaths peaked at 419. In
      1998 that number declined to 338. (See <a href="#Chart 1">Chart 1</a>.)
      During that same period, the number of deaths in which methamphetamine was
      mentioned decreased from 99 deaths in 1995 to 84 in 1998. The 1998 figure
      is the lowest since 1993 when only 77 deaths were reported.</p>

      <p>The availability of methamphetamine in San Diego and Imperial Counties
      is constant, and there has been no significant change in either price or
      purity. In their responses to the National Drug Intelligence Center's
      (NDIC) Drug Threat Survey, the San Diego Police Department, the San Diego
      Sheriff's Department, and the Chula Vista Police Department rated
      availability of methamphetamine as high. The San Diego Sheriff's
      Department and the San Diego Police Department rated the methamphetamine
      threat as major but unchanging; the Chula Vista Police Department
      identified the threat as major and increasing. The San Diego Police
      Department reports that it encounters methamphetamine in both rock and
      powder form in areas formerly dominated by crack. Currently,
      methamphetamine accounts for 50 percent of North San Diego Integrated Drug
      Task Force seizures; amounts seized range from 1 to 50 pounds. The Task
      Force reports the methamphetamine market is stable, prices are steady, and
      purity is between 20 and 94 percent.</p>
      <p>The most recent methamphetamine price and purity figures available from
      the Narcotic Information Network (NIN) for San Diego and Imperial Counties
      indicate slight increases in price and purity. (See<font color="#FF00FF"> </font><a

      <p>Seizures of methamphetamine at California POEs increased from 312
      pounds in 1998 to 577 pounds in 1999. The California Border Alliance Group
      (CBAG) reports that 1999 seizures in San Diego and Imperial Counties
      accounted for 54 percent (577 of 1,060 kg) of the methamphetamine seized
      at the Southwest Border, the highest since 1996. The California Bureau of
      Narcotics Enforcement (BNE) and the California Highway Patrol Border
      Division seized an additional 73 pounds of methamphetamine and 9,938
      pounds of pseudoephedrine in 1999. CBAG also reports seizures of the
      precursors ephedrine and pseudoephedrine and of the essential chemicals
      hydriodic acid and iodine at POEs.</p>

              decreased during the first six months of 2000. They further report
              that more of the drug is being crossed at other points along the

      <p>In 1998, 221 kilograms of amphetamine were seized at the Southwest
      Border, almost three times the amount seized in 1997. The Mexican DTOs are
      marketing amphetamine as methamphetamine. This may be an indication that
      Mexican DTOs are substituting phenylpropanolamine (PPA), either because
      federal controls are making it difficult to obtain the precursors
      ephedrine and pseudoephedrine or because of economics: PPA may be cheaper
      than either ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, thereby increasing the profit
      margin.</p>

      <p>Methamphetamine addicts suffering the effects of prolonged or chronic
      abuse often display psychotic behavior such as paranoia, auditory and
      visual hallucinations, or mood disturbances and exhibit a tendency toward
      violence. In March 2000, the San Diego Sheriff's Department stated that
      &quot;methamphetamine is a very dangerous drug that has been traced to
      violent criminal activity.&quot; It further reports that 70 percent of
      adult male and about 60 percent of juvenile arrestees test positive for
      methamphetamine, and comments, &quot;Although those figures are down from
      previous years, they are still the highest in the nation.&quot;</p>
      <p>In response to the NDIC's Gang Survey 2000, local law enforcement
      indicated that street gangs in their districts are involved in the
      distribution of methamphetamine and other drugs. In addition to the
      violent activity related to drug trafficking, these gangs also commit
      criminal acts such as assaults, drive-by shootings, homicides, auto thefts
      and carjackings. La Eme, which controls a portion of the drug trade in
      Southern California through street gangs, uses violence to maintain that
      control and expand its power base. The almost complete wholesale control
      of drug distribution in both San Diego and Imperial Counties by Mexican
      DTOs precludes some of the violence usually associated with the struggle
      for control of drug markets.</p>

      <p>Mexican criminals continue to be the primary methamphetamine producers
      in San Diego and Imperial Counties. Most use the ephedrine/pseudoephedrine
      reduction method, which produces greater amounts (10 lb or more) per cook.
      In addition to ephedrine/pseudoephedrine, this method uses red phosphorus
      and hydriodic acid. One source of pseudoephedrine used in the manufacture
      of methamphetamine is over-the-counter cold tablets. It appears that, in
      some cases, methamphetamine manufacturers use the entire tablet, including
      binders, which produces a poorer quality product because it lowers the
      purity and adds weight. Production of poor quality methamphetamine could
      be an attempt to cut costs, the result of difficulty in obtaining
      precursors, or both.</p>
      </font>
      <p>Because of the high levels of production, Southern California was once
      known as the methamphetamine capital of the United States. However,
      pressure from law enforcement in Southern California is causing operators
      of the larger laboratories to move further north to Orange and San
      Bernardino Counties, east to Arizona, and south to Baja California Norte.</p>

              The Mexican Attorney General's Office reported that 17 clandestine
              laboratories for making synthetic drugs have been dismantled in
              Michoacan. Eleven laboratories were dismantled in 1999 and six in
              the first 4 months of 2000. The report did not identify the types
              of drugs manufactured in the laboratories, however, Michoacan is
              known to be a center for methamphetamine production.</p>
              <p>A report from the Mexican newspapers dated October 17, 2000,
              stated that authorities in that country discovered an underground
              crystal [methamphetamine] laboratory on the highway between
              Mexicali, Mexico, and the Mexicali Airport.<br>

      <p>There is a continuing trend in Southern California toward small &quot;tweaker
      labs&quot; that produce ounce to pound quantities for personal use and
      sale. Most small laboratories are seized from residences, but laboratories
      also have been found in sheds in remote locations and in the trunks of
      cars. While operators of most small laboratories use the ephedrine/pseudoephedrine
      method used by Mexican DTOs, there have been reports of a few using the
      &quot;Nazi&quot; method, which requires a shorter cook time and uses
      anhydrous ammonia in place of red phosphorus. The DEA San Diego Field
      Division seized 41 methamphetamine laboratories and three pseudoephedrine
      extraction laboratories in 1998. DEA reported 43 laboratory seizures in
      1999. NIN reported that 62 laboratories were seized in San Diego County
      and 5 in Imperial County. NIN figures include additional laboratory
      seizures not reported to DEA. Methamphetamine laboratories are generally
      found in sparsely populated areas. In San Diego County, most of the
      laboratories seized were east and northeast of San Diego; in Imperial
      County, the laboratories were located west and northwest of El Centro.</p>
      <p>San Diego County authorities responding to the National Drug Threat
      Survey estimate the cost of cleaning up a laboratory at $3,000. In 1999,
      DEA spent over $83,000 on 46 laboratory cleanups. This figure does not
      include the remediation cost of returning a laboratory site to its former
      condition, that is, removing contaminants from the water supply, soil, or
      structures in which the laboratories were operated. A recent report from
      the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund Program in San
      Francisco indicated that neither the EPA nor the state of California is
      funding the decontamination of structures used as methamphetamine
      laboratories. The cost of assessment and cleanup of structures can reach
      as high as $50,000 per unit.</p>
      <p>U.S. Forest Service (USFS) sources report that methamphetamine
      producers set up laboratories on public land and dump the toxic
      by-products directly on the ground, causing serious environmental damage.
      At the very least, the resulting cleanup is costly; in the worst case
      scenario the damage to the environment is irreparable. The USFS also
      reports cases of traffickers who enter abandoned laboratory sites and set
      up &quot;dirt labs&quot; where they scrub the contaminated soil to recover
      methamphetamine and precursor residue.</p>

              The California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement reports that a very
              enterprising methamphetamine cooker cut up the sheets used to
              strain the product and then sold the pieces to methamphetamine
              users. The users soak the pieces of cloth in drinkable liquids to
              ingest the methamphetamine.<br>

      <p>Precursor and essential chemical trafficking is another
      methamphetamine-related problem facing law enforcement in San Diego and
      Imperial Counties. Because large quantities of ephedrine and
      pseudoephedrine are not readily available in the district, methamphetamine
      manufacturers and precursor &quot;brokers&quot; are forced to purchase
      products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine over the counter, smuggle
      the chemicals into the area from Mexico, or obtain them from unscrupulous
      chemical companies. In addition, these criminal broker organizations may
      also set up laboratories to extract the ephedrine or pseudoephedrine from
      combination products such as cold medicines.</p>
      <p>In some instances, traffickers may acquire case quantities of ephedrine
      and pseudoephedrine products from operators of convenience stores and
      liquor stores. These store operators usually purchase the products from
      suppliers on the East Coast. The DEA San Diego Field Division and CBAG
      report that Middle Eastern criminals are the largest single ethnic group
      distributing pseudoephedrine tablets at both the wholesale and retail
      levels in the San Diego area. In January 2000, the California Highway
      Patrol seized 380,000 dosage units of pseudoephedrine from a Jordanian who
      was traveling from Vancouver to Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>The smuggling of precursors and essential chemicals, both north and
      south, continues at the California-Mexico border. Ephedrine and
      pseudoephedrine seizures in Southern California in 1999 totaled 67
      kilograms compared to 408 kilograms in 1998. In 1999, 675 pounds of iodine
      were seized. In December 1999, USCS at the Calexico POE seized 5 gallons
      of hydriodic acid that was concealed inside oil containers in the trunk of
      a car. In February 2000, USCS inspectors seized 217 pounds of crystalline
      iodine that was concealed in the seat of a pickup truck. The truck was
      driven by an alleged member of a Los Angeles street gang.</p>
      <p>Federal and state regulations have made the purchase of precursor and
      essential chemicals within the United States increasingly difficult,
      forcing Mexican DTOs to obtain precursors from other countries. The major
      source countries for ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are China, India,
      Poland, and Germany. In addition to tightening the supply, stringent
      regulation has resulted in increased prices for these chemicals on the
      black market. One example is the price of iodine, which costs about $1,995
      per 50 kilogram compared to the black market price of $9,000-$9,500. The
      most recent prices reported by NIN are shown in <a href="#Table 5">Table 5</a>.</p>

      <p align="left">The Southern California District continues to be a
      destination area for methamphetamine. However, it is principally a
      transshipment point; most of the methamphetamine smuggled into the area
      from Mexico is destined for other locations in California and the United
      States. A variety of conveyances and concealment methods are used in
      smuggling methamphetamine into the United States. The most popular places
      of concealment in commercial and personal vehicles include hidden
      compartments, air bag compartments, quarter panels, and gas tanks. USCS
      recently seized 21 pounds of methamphetamine concealed inside an air bag
      compartment and a front seat cushion, 25 pounds concealed behind the rear
      seat of a car, and 27 pounds from the gas tank of a pickup truck.</p>
      <p align="left">Traffickers frequently use couriers; the drug may be
      hand-carried or concealed on the body (body-packed). In two incidents at
      the San Ysidro POE in December 1999, a resident flying from San Diego to
      New Orleans attempted to smuggle 2 kilograms taped to his body. In an
      incident at the Tecate POE in April 2000, a pedestrian tried to enter with
      8 pounds strapped around his waist.</p>

      <p align="left">Mexican polydrug organizations, usually working in
      conjunction with middlemen, are the major suppliers of methamphetamine at
      the wholesale level in San Diego and Imperial Counties. Hispanic street
      gangs and independent dealers and groups (Caucasian and Hispanic) are the
      main distributors at the street level. The two-county area is also home to
      independent laboratory operators who produce small amounts of
      methamphetamine for their own consumption and for sale.</p>

              In February 2000, narcotics agents in Mexicali, Mexico, seized 85
              pounds of methamphetamine. The street value of the seizure could
              range from $250,000 to over $1.5 million, depending on whether it
              was destined for sale in Mexico or the United States. The 85
              pounds seized probably represents only a small amount of the
              methamphetamine being produced in Baja California Norte.<br>

      <p align="left">Most of the methamphetamine found in the district is
      produced in Mexico. The border cities in San Diego and Imperial Counties
      continue to be used as methamphetamine transshipment points to U.S.
      locales and the smuggling of methamphetamine continues to increase. The
      primary sources of supply are Mexican DTOs such as the Arellano-Felix
      Organization, the Amezcua-Contreras Organization, and the Miguel Angel
      Caro-Quintero Organization. According to a 1998 U.S. Attorney report,
      Mexican organizations have come to dominate wholesale methamphetamine
      trafficking in the United States because they have ready access to
      precursor chemicals in Mexico, they control well-established drug
      distribution networks, and they produce large quantities of
      methamphetamine on a regular basis.</p>
      <p align="left">At the wholesale level, Mexican DTOs normally work through
      middlemen who use known dealers to distribute the methamphetamine at the
      street level. Most of the drug distribution groups at the wholesale and
      retail levels are polydrug in nature.</p>
      <p align="left">Responses to a survey conducted by NIN indicated that
      approximately 54 criminal organizations transport and distribute
      methamphetamine and 14 traffic precursor chemicals in the Southern
      California and Mexico Border Regions. They also identified 76 polydrug
      organizations or groups, some of which most likely are involved in
      methamphetamine trafficking.<b><br>
      </b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font color="#800000"><a name="Retail">Retail</a></font></p>
      </b>
      <p align="left">The primary retail distributors of methamphetamine in the
      district are Mexican criminals and Mexican-American criminal groups. Local
      independent dealers, street gangs, Caucasians, and biker gangs also
      distribute the drug. The Chula Vista Police Department states that
      Mexicans, as well as Caucasians and biker gangs, distribute
      methamphetamine in its area. DEA reports that the Hells Angels Motorcycle
      Club is establishing a chapter in Tijuana; however, a working relationship
      between the Hells Angels and Mexican DTOs has not been confirmed.</p>
      <p align="left">According to the San Diego Sheriff's Department, the
      dominant distributors of methamphetamine in San Diego County are
      Caucasians with connections to the Arellano-Felix Organization. The San
      Diego Police Department describes a layered drug distribution network
      whereby Mexican DTOs deal with middlemen who then work with known
      dealers--from gangs to individuals--who handle street sales. Most of the
      drug dealing at the street level is polydrug.</p>
      <p align="left">Another criminal influence that impacts methamphetamine
      distribution in Southern California is the Mexican Mafia, a prison-based
      gang also known as &quot;La Eme.&quot; La Eme controls a portion of the
      drug distribution in Southern California through control of street gangs
      like the Logan Heights gang. La Eme also has ties to the prison-based gang
      Aryan Brotherhood that, in turn, has ties to outlaw motorcycle gangs. It
      is believed that Aryan Brotherhood is linked to the methamphetamine trade
      through its association with these groups. Other street gangs distributing
      methamphetamine in the San Diego area are the Vista Home Boys, Vario
      Fallbrook Locos, Imperials, Lakeside Gangsters, Colonia Eden Gardens,
      Vario Encitas, Legend Kings, Casa De Oro Bloods (African-American and
      Hispanic), Spring Valley Locos, and Vario San Marcos. These gangs are also
      involved in the distribution of other drugs, including marijuana and
      heroin.</p>

              Hispanic Street Gangs</font></h3>
              <font size="3">
              <p>Hispanic street gangs dominate the gang population in
              California. Law enforcement in California identified 1,818 active
              Hispanic street gangs. Incarcerated members of Southern California
              Hispanic gangs tend to align themselves with the prison-based
              gang, La Eme, which exerts substantial influence over the
              activities of many Hispanic street gangs. These alignments often
              result in acts of violence. From 1992 to 1998, the California
              Department of Justice recorded 2,993 Hispanic gang-related
              homicides--61 percent of all gang-related homicides in California.
              Historically, Hispanic gangs were exclusively male but female
              Hispanic gangs are increasing. In addition to drug distribution,
              criminal activities committed by Hispanic gangs (male or female)
              include robbery, burglary, grand theft, auto theft, assault,
              drive-by shooting, murder, home invasion robbery, weapons
              trafficking, and witness tampering.</p>

              members are violent and use high-powered automatic weapons.
              Criminal activities include narcotics trafficking, robbery,

      <p align="left">The North County Regional Task Force in San Diego reports
      that street gangs account for about 50 percent of the drug distribution in
      the county. The major Hispanic gangs were identified as Pasole, Center
      Street Logos, Mesa Logos operating in Oceanside, and the Vista Home Boys
      in Vista. In Carlsbad, the major gangs are the Carlsbad Logos, South Los,
      and Vario San Marcos. Also mentioned were the Diablos and Westside Gang in
      Escondido and the Fallbrook Logos in Fallbrook. Drug distribution is the
      gangs' primary business, and although they distribute all drugs,
      methamphetamine is predominant. The Task Force further reports that all
      Hispanic gangs owe their allegiance to the Mexican Mafia (La Eme).
      Graffiti displaying various Spanish gang logos is usually followed by Sur
      13: the thirteenth letter of the alphabet is M, &quot;eme&quot; in
      Spanish. The Crips, an African-American street gang, also distributes
      methamphetamine in addition to the usual crack cocaine, according to Task
      Force reporting.</p>
      <p align="left">The Imperial County Task Force identified 34 street gangs
      with more than 850 members. Most of the Hispanic street gangs are involved
      in polydrug distribution that includes methamphetamine, heroin, and

      <p align="left">Other dangerous drugs (ODDs) include club drugs such as
      MDMA, GHB and its analogs, ketamine, the hallucinogens LSD and PCP, and
      Rohypnol. ODDs also include inhalants and diverted pharmaceuticals. MDMA
      is readily available and abused in Arizona and poses a considerable threat
      to the state. Other ODDs present varying threats to Arizona. Various
      criminal groups and independent dealers transport ODDs to Arizona via
      private vehicles, couriers on commercial and private aircraft, couriers
      traveling by foot entering the United States from Mexico, and package
      delivery services. Club drugs primarily are sold and abused by
      middle-class, suburban, young adults at raves and nightclubs and on
      college campuses. Hallucinogens are also distributed by local independent
      dealers throughout the state. Pharmaceuticals such as hydrocodone
      (Vicodin), benzodiazepine (Valium, Xanax), oxycodone (OxyContin, Percocet,
      Percodan), steroids, and codeine typically are diverted through a variety
      of techniques including &quot;doctor shopping,&quot; pharmacy diversion,
      prescription forgery, smuggling from Mexico, and purchasing over the
      Internet, particularly from foreign sources such as Mexico.

<p align="left">Club drugs consist of illicit drugs that are commonly diverted
and used at dance clubs and raves, including MDMA, GHB and its analogs,
ketamine, LSD, PCP, and Rohypnol. Club drugs are becoming increasingly popular
in Arizona, particularly among teenagers and young adults. Club drugs are a
major concern among law enforcement and health professionals in Arizona, who
report increasing availability and use. According to the 2001 ACJC Survey of
Narcotics Officers, 80 percent of respondents reported club drug abuse as a
problem in their jurisdictions and 78 percent reported investigations involving
club drugs. The increasing number of incidents involving MDMA abuse is of
particular concern.</p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#800000">MDMA</font></b>. Also known as Adam, ecstasy,
XTC, E, and X, MDMA
(3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine) is a stimulant and low-level hallucinogen.
The drug was patented in 1914 in Germany, where it was sometimes given to
psychiatric patients to assist in psychotherapy, a practice never approved by
the American Psychological Association or the Food and Drug Administration.
MDMA, sometimes called the hug drug, is said to make users &quot;feel
good&quot;; they claim that the drug helps them to be more &quot;in touch&quot;
with others and that it &quot;opens channels of communication.&quot; However,
abuse of the drug can cause psychological problems similar to those associated
with methamphetamine and cocaine abuse, including confusion, depression,
sleeplessness, anxiety, and paranoia. Negative physical effects can also result,
including muscle tension, involuntary teeth clenching, blurred vision, and
increased heart rate and blood pressure. MDMA abuse can also cause a marked
increase in body temperature leading to muscle breakdown, kidney failure,
cardiovascular system failure, stroke, or seizure as reported in some fatal
cases. Researchers suggest that MDMA abuse may result in long-term and sometimes
permanent damage to parts of the brain that are critical to thought and memory.</p>
<p align="left">MDMA abuse is growing in Arizona. According to the DEA Phoenix
Division, MDMA abuse is expanding beyond the nightclub scene due to abuser
perceptions that the drug is not dangerous. DAWN data indicate that MDMA ED
mentions in the Phoenix metropolitan area increased dramatically from 6 in 1997
to 96 in 2001. Increasing MDMA availability in suburban and rural areas
contributes to the threat.</p>

<p align="left">MDMA abuse is fairly common among youth in Arizona. According to
the ACJC 2002 State of Arizona Youth Survey, 8.3 percent of junior and senior
high school students surveyed in 2002 reported that they had used MDMA at least
once in their lifetime; only marijuana and inhalants had higher percentages of
reported use. Of the students surveyed, 12.0 percent of twelfth grade students,
8.2 percent of tenth grade students, and 5.5 percent of eighth grade students in
Arizona reported using MDMA at least once in their lifetime.</p>

              <blockquote>

<p align="left">Throughout the 1990s high energy, all-night dances known as
raves, which feature techno music and flashing laser lights, increased in
popularity among teens and young adults. Raves typically occur in permanent
dance clubs or temporary weekend event sites set up in abandoned warehouses,
open fields, empty buildings, or civic centers. Club drugs are a group of
synthetic drugs often sold at raves and dance clubs. MDMA is one of the most
popular club drugs. Rave managers often sell water, pacifiers, and glow sticks
at rave parties. &quot;Ravers&quot; require water to offset dehydration caused
by MDMA abuse; use pacifiers to avoid grinding their teeth--a common side effect
of MDMA abuse; and wave glow sticks in front of their eyes because MDMA
stimulates light perception.</p>

<p align="left">MDMA is widely available in virtually all major metropolitan
areas such as Phoenix and Tucson. In addition, availability is increasing in
suburban areas and smaller towns, according to law enforcement officials
throughout the state. Moreover, the Scottsdale Police Department reported that
MDMA is the most prevalent drug of abuse in its jurisdiction.</p>
<p align="left">Most of the MDMA available in Arizona is produced in the
Netherlands and Belgium; however, MDMA also is produced to a very limited extent
in Arizona. In October 2001 law enforcement officials arrested a college
professor for producing MDMA. He had purchased precursor chemicals through the
college and used equipment from the college to produce the drug. The man
distributed the drug within Arizona and in California and Idaho. In May 2000 law
enforcement officials seized an MDMA laboratory operated by Caucasian college
students in Flagstaff.</p>
<p align="left">MDMA is smuggled into Arizona from Europe and, to an increasing
extent, from Mexico and transported from states such as California and Nevada,
primarily by Israeli and Asian criminal groups. Mexican DTOs also smuggle MDMA
across the Arizona portion of the U.S.-Mexico border, but to a much lesser
extent. MDMA is transported using a variety of means such as couriers on foot
entering the United States from Mexico, couriers traveling on commercial and
private aircraft, private vehicles, and package delivery services. Couriers are
increasingly transporting MDMA from Europe into Mexico by air and then smuggling
it across the Arizona portion of the U.S.-Mexico border by vehicle to avoid
customs officials at airports. Independent dealers and abusers often travel to
border towns in Mexico to purchase MDMA. The drug is transported from Las Vegas
and Los Angeles primarily by private vehicle. MDMA increasingly is being
transported into the state by package delivery services.</p>
<p align="left">Asian and Caucasian criminal groups and independent dealers are
the primary wholesale and retail distributors of MDMA in Arizona. OMGs such as
Hells Angels and street gangs such as Devil Dogs also distribute MDMA at the
retail level. Many retail-level MDMA distributors are middle- and
upper-middle-class Caucasian high school or college age students. MDMA
distribution at the retail level typically occurs at the point of use such as
raves or bars. According to DEA, in the fourth quarter of FY2002 MDMA sold for
$5 per tablet for 10,000 tablets, $7 to $10 per tablet for 1,000 tablets, and
$20 to $25 for a single tablet.</p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#800000">GHB and Analogs</font></b>. GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyrate) and its analogs
(see <a href="#GHB"> text box</a>) pose a low but increasing drug threat to Arizona. GHB is a
depressant that occurs naturally in the body and is necessary for complete
functioning of the brain and central nervous system. GHB analogs are drugs that
possess chemical structures that closely resemble GHB. GHB and its analogs also
are known as liquid MDMA, scoop, grievous bodily harm, and Georgia home boy. GHB
and its analogs increasingly have been involved in poisonings, overdoses, and
fatalities nationwide. Overdoses can occur quickly; some signs include
drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, loss of consciousness, impaired breathing, and
sometimes death. GHB and its analogs often are used in the commission of
drug-facilitated sexual assault because of their sedative properties. The drugs
are eliminated from the body quickly, which makes it difficult for healthcare
professionals to detect them using blood and urine screenings. In the Phoenix
metropolitan area GHB-related ED mentions decreased from 19 in 2001 to 14 in
2002, according to DAWN.</p>

<p align="left">GHB is sold and abused at social venues such as bars,
nightclubs, and raves and on college campuses. Caucasian adolescents and young
adults are the predominant distributors and abusers of GHB. Law enforcement
officials throughout Arizona have reported increased availability and abuse of
GHB in their jurisdictions, particularly in small towns.</p>
<p align="left">Law enforcement officials in Arizona report the availability of
GBL (gamma-butyrolactone), an analog of GHB, in the state. GBL is used
legitimately as a wax stripper or health supplement. It is widely sold in powder
and liquid form at gyms, fitness centers, health food stores, and via the
Internet. In March 2000 Arizona law enforcement officials arrested a Phoenix man
who sold GBL nationwide over the Internet. He bought 55-gallon drums from
distributors for $1,000 and sold the drums for $3,200 each. He also sold GBL in
25-pound containers for $400 each. He used package delivery services to
transport 55-gallon drums of GBL to distributors in cities throughout the United
States including Albuquerque, Boca Raton (FL), Boston, Chicago, Detroit, and
Lansdale (PA). Law enforcement officials seized 33 55-gallon drums of GBL from
the operation.</p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#800000">Ketamine</font></b>. The threat posed to Arizona by the distribution
and abuse of ketamine is relatively stable. Ketamine, also known as K, special
K, vitamin K, ket, kit-kat, and cat valium, is sold commercially as Ketalar.
Ketamine was placed on the Schedule III controlled substance list in the United
States on July 13, 1999. However, the drug is still available over the counter
in Mexico, where it is known as Kelar. It is an injectable anesthetic that has
been approved for both human and animal use. Ketamine is produced in liquid,
powder, or tablet form. In its liquid form, it can be injected either
intramuscularly or intravenously. In powdered form, ketamine can be mistaken for
cocaine or methamphetamine and often is snorted or smoked with marijuana or
tobacco products.</p>
<p align="left">High doses of ketamine can cause delirium, amnesia, impaired
motor function, high blood pressure, depression, and potentially fatal
respiratory problems. Low doses impair attention, learning ability, and memory.
Short-term use of ketamine causes hallucinations; its major effect is
dissociation, which includes out-of-body and near-death experiences. Ketamine
gained popularity among abusers in the 1980s when it was discovered that large
doses caused effects similar to those experienced with PCP. According to DAWN,
ketamine-related ED mentions in the Phoenix metropolitan area increased from 4
in 2001 to 13 in 2002.</p>
<p align="left">Ketamine is available in Arizona and typically is sold at
nightclubs and raves. Several police departments throughout Arizona have
reported increased availability and abuse of the drug. Ketamine is predominantly
abused by young adults and often is abused with MDMA, a practice known as
trail-mixing. Caucasian local independent dealers are the primary distributors
of ketamine in the state; however, the Phoenix Police Department reports that
Asian local independent dealers also distribute the drug. Distributors typically
purchase ketamine at pharmacies in Mexican border towns and smuggle it into
Arizona or divert the drug from legitimate sources, primarily veterinary
clinics. Law enforcement officials seized 3,544 bottles of ketamine in February
2002 and 3,970 bottles of ketamine in January 2002 during vehicle interdictions
in northern Arizona.</p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#800000">LSD</font></b>. The distribution and abuse of LSD (lysergic acid
diethylamide) pose a low threat to Arizona. LSD, also known as acid, boomers,
and yellow sunshine, is a hallucinogen that induces abnormalities in sensory
perceptions. The effects of LSD are unpredictable depending upon the amount
taken, the environment in which it is abused, and the abuser's personality,
mood, and expectations. Abusers may feel the immediate effects for up to 12
hours. The physical effects include dilated pupils, higher body temperature,
increased heart rate and blood pressure, sweating, loss of appetite, nausea,
numbness, weakness, insomnia, dry mouth, and tremors. Two long-term disorders
associated with LSD are persistent psychosis and flashbacks. According to DAWN,
LSD-related ED mentions in the Phoenix metropolitan area increased from 71 in
1997 to 156 in 1999, then decreased to 62 in 2001 and 15 in 2002.</p>
<p align="left">LSD is primarily available in urban areas of Arizona; however,
its availability is increasing in some suburban areas and smaller towns. Most of
the LSD available in Arizona is produced in California and is transported into
the state by local independent dealers in private vehicles. Caucasian young
adults are the primary distributors and abusers of LSD in the state. The Phoenix
Police Department reports that Asian independent dealers also distribute the
drug in its jurisdiction. The drug is predominantly sold at raves, bars,
nightclubs, and on college campuses. LSD is typically available as powder,
liquid, tablets, capsules, gel tabs, and on pieces of blotter paper that absorb
the drug.</p>
<p align="left">LSD prices vary depending on the quantity purchased. According
to DEA, one dosage unit of blotter LSD sold for $2 to $3, while liquid LSD in
breath mint bottles (approximately 90 dosage units) sold for $140 to $150 per
bottle in the second quarter of FY2002.</p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#800000">PCP</font></b>. The distribution and abuse of the hallucinogen PCP
(phencyclidine) pose a low but increasing threat to Arizona, particularly
Phoenix. PCP was developed as an intravenous anesthetic, but use of the drug in
humans was discontinued in 1965 because patients became agitated, delusional,
and irrational while recovering from its effects. PCP, also known as angel dust,
embalming fluid, ozone, wack, and rocket fuel, is produced illegally in
laboratories in the United States. It is a white crystalline powder that is
soluble in water and has a bitter taste. The drug can be mixed with dyes and is
available as a tablet, capsule, liquid, or colored powder.</p>
<p align="left">PCP may be snorted, smoked, injected, or swallowed. When smoked,
PCP often is applied to mint, parsley, oregano, tobacco, or marijuana. When
combined with marijuana, the mixture is called killer joint or crystal
supergrass. PCP also is administered by dipping a marijuana cigarette in a
solution of PCP-laced embalming fluid and smoking it. This combination is known
as fry or amp.</p>
<p align="left">PCP is available primarily in Phoenix; it is available in other
areas of Arizona, but to a much lesser extent. In the Phoenix metropolitan area,
PCP-related ED mentions increased from 40 in 1997 to 61 in 2001 and 83 in 2002,
according to DAWN. Most PCP in Arizona is produced in California and transported
into the state primarily by local independent dealers in private vehicles. Local
independent dealers are the primary distributors of PCP in the state. However,
the Phoenix Police Department reported that street gangs distribute PCP in its
jurisdiction. PCP typically is distributed at the same venues as club drugs and
primarily is abused by young adults.</p>

concern in Arizona. According to the ACJC 2002 State of Arizona Youth Survey,
7.4 percent of junior and senior high school students surveyed reported that
they had used LSD/hallucinogens at least once in their lifetime. Of the students
surveyed, 12.6 percent of twelfth grade students, 8.3 percent of tenth grade
students, and 2.4 percent of eighth grade students in Arizona reported using
LSD/hallucinogens at least once in their lifetime. Hallucinogens ranked second

<p align="left"><b><font color="#800000">Rohypnol</font></b>. Rohypnol (flunitrazepam) is a low but increasing
drug threat to Arizona. Rohypnol, also called roofies, rophies, Roche, and the
forget-me pill, belongs to a class of drugs known as benzodiazepines, which also
includes Valium, Halcion, Xanax, and Versed. Rohypnol is not approved for
prescription use in the United States. Rohypnol is odorless, tasteless, and
dissolves completely in liquid. It produces sedative-hypnotic effects including
muscle relaxation and amnesia and can cause physiological and psychological
dependence. Rohypnol often is used in the commission of drug-facilitated sexual
assaults because of its sedative properties. The effects of Rohypnol can impair
or incapacitate a victim for 8 to 12 hours and are exacerbated by the use of
alcohol.</p>
<p align="left">Rohypnol is predominantly abused by young adults in Arizona.
Several police departments throughout Arizona have reported increased
availability and abuse of the drug. Caucasian local independent dealers are the
primary distributors of Rohypnol in the state; however, the Yuma Police
Department reports that Hispanic street gangs also distribute the drug.
Distributors typically purchase Rohypnol at pharmacies in Mexican border towns
and smuggle it into Arizona for personal use and distribution. La Paz County law
enforcement officials reported that Rohypnol has been used in the commission of
sexual assaults in their jurisdiction.</p>

<p align="left">Inhalant abuse among Arizona youth is a significant problem.
Inhalant abuse, also known as huffing, is the sniffing of common household
products such as paint, gasoline, and hair spray. Sniffing inhalants introduces
toxins into the body that can damage the liver, lungs, kidney, and brain or even
cause death. According to the ACJC 2002 State of Arizona Youth Survey, 10.9
percent of junior and senior high school students surveyed reported that they
had used inhalants at least once in their lifetime. Of the students surveyed,
10.1 percent of Arizona twelfth grade students, 10.4 percent of tenth grade
students, and 11.9 percent of eighth grade students reported using inhalants at
least once in their lifetime. Inhalants ranked second to marijuana for the
highest percentage of eighth and tenth grade students who reported having tried
these substances.</p>

<font color="#800000">Nitrous Oxide Use</font></b></p>

            <blockquote>

<p align="left">Often abused by adolescents in Arizona, nitrous oxide is a
clear, colorless gas that is used as an anesthetic and as a propellant in the
food industry. When the gas is inhaled, it is quickly absorbed by the lungs and
distributed throughout the body. Short-term effects include headaches,
dizziness, slurred speech, imbalance when walking, immunity to stimuli such as
pain or loud noises, and unconsciousness. Death can occur in a matter of minutes
if a person inhales nitrous oxide in a confined space such as a small room or an
automobile.</p>

      </table>
      </center>
    </div>
<p align="left">Side effects associated with the abuse of inhalants include
dizziness, strong hallucinations, delusions, belligerence, apathy, and impaired
judgment. Long-term abusers experience additional problems including weight
loss, muscle weakness, disorientation, inattentiveness, lack of coordination,
irritability, and depression. Chronic inhalant abuse may cause serious and
sometimes irreversible damage to the user's heart, liver, kidneys, lungs, and
brain. Brain damage may result in personality changes, diminished cognitive
functioning, memory impairment, and slurred speech. Death can occur after a
single use of inhalants or after prolonged use. Sudden sniffing death (SSD) may
result within minutes of inhalant abuse from irregular heart rhythm leading to
heart failure.</p>
<p align="left">Nitrous oxide is readily available in Arizona. Nitrous oxide can
be purchased in canisters (whippets) at head shops (retail outlets that cater to
drug users), catering supply stores, and over the Internet. Nitrous oxide also
is commonly sold at raves in whippets or inflated balloons. Abusers typically
use the gas to inflate a balloon and then breathe in the gas from the balloon.
Nitrous oxide-filled balloons typically are sold at raves for $2 to $5 each. In
response to growing abuse among youth, the Arizona legislature passed a law in

    <p align="left">Diverted pharmaceuticals pose an increasing threat to
    Arizona. An estimated 15 percent of drug treatment provided in Phoenix is
    attributed to the abuse of diverted pharmaceuticals. The Scottsdale Police
    Department reports that the abuse of pharmaceuticals increases when MDMA
    availability decreases. Pharmaceuticals are diverted and abused by a variety
    of individuals ranging from adolescents to older adults. The most commonly
    diverted pharmaceuticals in Arizona include hydrocodone (Vicodin),
    benzodiazepine (Valium, Xanax), oxycodone (OxyContin, Percocet, Percodan),
    diazepam (Valium), steroids, and codeine.</p>
    <p align="left">Pharmaceuticals are diverted in a variety of ways in
    Arizona, including &quot;doctor shopping,&quot; pharmacy diversion,
    prescription forgery, smuggling from Mexico, and purchasing over the
    Internet, particularly from foreign sources such as Mexico. Doctor shopping
    is a practice by which individuals who may or may not have a legitimate
    ailment visit numerous physicians to obtain drugs in excess of what should
    be prescribed legitimately. A significant portion of the diverted
    pharmaceuticals available in Arizona are smuggled from Mexico. Forging
    prescriptions is the primary method by which pharmaceuticals are diverted in
    Arizona. According to the DEA Phoenix Division, in 2001 law enforcement
    officials uncovered an OxyContin prescription fraud group operating in the
    Phoenix area. The individuals used fraudulent prescriptions and paid for the
    drugs either with cash or by billing an insurance company using information
    obtained from stolen medical records. Officials reported that more than 20
    individuals were involved in the organization. Diverted pharmaceuticals sold
    for $1 to $40 per dosage unit in 2002 in Arizona.</p>

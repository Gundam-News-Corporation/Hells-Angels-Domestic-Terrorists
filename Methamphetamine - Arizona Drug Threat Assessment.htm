      <h2><font color="#800000"><a name="start">M</a>ethamphetamine</font></h2>
      <p align="left">Methamphetamine is a primary drug threat to Arizona. High
purity, low cost methamphetamine is readily available, and the drug is abused
throughout the state. Crystal methamphetamine is becoming increasingly available
throughout Arizona; some areas report higher levels of abuse of crystal methamphetamine
than powdered methamphetamine. Methamphetamine produced in Mexico is the
predominant type available in the state. Methamphetamine produced in Arizona and
other states, particularly California and Nevada, also is available, but to a
lesser extent. Methamphetamine is produced in the state by Caucasian criminal
groups and independent producers. They typically produce the drug in ounce
quantities using the iodine/red phosphorus method. Mexican DTOs, Mexican
criminal groups, outlaw motorcycle gangs (OMGs), and Mexican independent
laboratory operators also produce methamphetamine in Arizona, but to a lesser
extent. Mexican DTOs and criminal groups control the transportation and
wholesale distribution of most methamphetamine. Caucasian criminal groups,
Caucasian and Mexican local independent dealers, OMGs, and Hispanic gangs also
distribute the drug at the wholesale level. Caucasian and Mexican criminal
groups, Caucasian and Mexican local independent dealers, OMGs, Hispanic street
gangs, and prison gangs dominate retail-level methamphetamine distribution in
the state.

      <h3><font color="#800000"><a name="Abuse">Abuse</a></font></h3>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine abuse is increasing in Arizona. Law enforcement
agencies throughout the state report that the level of methamphetamine abuse is
rising in their jurisdictions and that Caucasians appear to be the primary
abusers. In response to the National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) National
Drug Threat Survey (NDTS) 2002, 29 of the 36 law enforcement respondents in
Arizona who rated the levels of methamphetamine abuse in their jurisdictions
reported high levels of abuse, 6 reported medium abuse levels, and 1 reported a
low level of abuse. Twelve respondents did not rate the level of methamphetamine
abuse in their jurisdictions. Moreover, law enforcement agencies in several
areas reported that the abuse of crystal methamphetamine has become more
prevalent in their jurisdictions than the abuse of powdered methamphetamine.</p>

<p align="left">The National Drug Threat Survey (NDTS) 2002 was administered by
NDIC to a representative sample of state and local law enforcement agencies
throughout the United States to assess the availability, abuse, and overall
threat posed by all major drugs. NDIC received 2,906 survey responses from law
enforcement agencies, an overall response rate of 80 percent. Survey respondents
were asked to rank the greatest drug threats to their areas and to indicate the
level of availability for each major drug type. They also were asked to provide
information on specific groups involved in the transportation and distribution
of illicit drugs. Responding agencies also provided narrative assessments of
various aspects of the overall drug situation and the threat that specific drugs
posed to their areas. Survey responses are used by NDIC to substantiate and
augment drug threat information obtained from other federal, state, and local
law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p align="left">According to TEDS, the number of amphetamine-related treatment
admissions to publicly funded treatment facilities in Arizona increased from 812
in 1998 to 1,267 in 2001, then decreased to 765 in 2002. (Nationwide, 95 percent
of amphetamine-related treatment admissions reported to TEDS are
methamphetamine-related.) The number of amphetamine-related admissions was
greater than for any other illicit drug in 2002. Moreover, treatment providers
in the state report that stimulant abusers are switching from crack cocaine to
crystal methamphetamine because it can be smoked like crack, is readily
available, and is less expensive.</p>
<p align="left">The number of amphetamine/methamphetamine-related emergency
department (ED) mentions in the Phoenix metropolitan area has increased for the
past 5 years. According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN),
amphetamine/methamphetamine-related ED mentions increased from 808 in 1998 to
860 in 1999, 1,261 in 2000, 1,492 in 2001, and 1,937 in 2002. In 2002 the rate
of methamphetamine-related ED mentions per 100,000 population in the Phoenix
metropolitan area (17) was dramatically higher than the rate nationwide (7).</p>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine-related deaths in Arizona increased
significantly from 1997 through 2001. According to DAWN mortality data, the
number of deaths in which methamphetamine was a factor in the Phoenix
metropolitan area more than tripled from 34 in 1997 to 122 in 2001. Phoenix
ranked first in the number of methamphetamine-related deaths among the 33
metropolitan areas reporting to DAWN in 2001. In addition, methamphetamine and
amphetamine were the only illicit drugs for which deaths increased in the
Phoenix metropolitan area during 2001.</p>

<p align="left">The number of individuals testing positive for methamphetamine
in employment-related drug screenings in Arizona also has increased in recent
years. According to the Arizona HIDTA, a private testing laboratory conducted
108,562 screenings in 1999, 155,559 in 2000, and 171,845 in 2001.
Methamphetamine was present in 1,017 of the 8,338 positive results in 1999
(12.2%), 1,704 of the 12,258 positive results in 2000 (13.9%), and 1,859 of the
12,208 positive results in 2001 (15.2%).</p>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine abuse is very common among adult male arrestees
in Phoenix; methamphetamine abuse also occurs among adult male arrestees in
Tucson, but to a lesser extent. According to the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring
(ADAM) program, in 2001, 25.3 percent of adult male arrestees who were screened
for drug abuse tested positive for methamphetamine use in Phoenix, and 5.4
percent tested positive in Tucson. Phoenix had the fifth highest rate of
methamphetamine abuse among the 31 cities reported by ADAM.</p>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine commonly is abused among adolescents in Arizona.
The drug is becoming increasingly popular among teenagers, according to the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) Phoenix Division. According to the 2002 State
of Arizona Youth Survey, which is conducted by the Arizona Criminal Justice
Commission (ACJC), 5.9 percent of junior and senior high school students
reported that they had used methamphetamine/amphetamines at least once in their
lifetime. Moreover, 8.6 percent of twelfth grade students, 6.8 percent of tenth
grade students, and 2.9 percent of eighth grade students in Arizona reported
using methamphetamine/amphetamines at least once in their lifetime.</p>

      <font color="#800000"><a name="Availability">Availability</a></font></h3>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine is widely available throughout Arizona. Of the
37 Arizona law enforcement respondents to the NDTS 2002 who rated the level of
methamphetamine availability in their jurisdictions, 34 reported high
availability, 2 reported medium availability, and 1 reported low availability.
Methamphetamine produced in Mexico is the most dominant type; however,
methamphetamine produced in Arizona and California is available at different
levels throughout the state. Powdered methamphetamine is the most prevalent type
available; however, crystal methamphetamine is becoming increasingly available
and, in some areas, is the only type available.</p>
<p align="left">Seizure data indicate the ready availability of methamphetamine
in Arizona. According to FDSS data, the amount of methamphetamine seized in
Arizona increased dramatically from 56 kilograms in 1998 to 293 kilograms in
2002. FDSS data indicate that Arizona ranked third in the nation for
methamphetamine seizures in 2002. Further, EPIC reports that the amount of
methamphetamine seized in Arizona within 150 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border
increased substantially from 60 kilograms in 1999 to 173 kilograms in 2000, to
367 kilograms in 2001, then decreased to 312 kilograms in 2002. (See <a href="#Table 1"> Table
1</a>.)
(Disparities in seizure reporting are likely a result of differences in data
collection and reporting methodologies.)</p>

<p align="left">The percentage of federal drug sentences that were
methamphetamine-related in Arizona was lower than the national percentage in
FY2001. According to USSC data, 7.2 percent of federal drug sentences in Arizona
in FY2001 were
methamphetamine-related compared with 14.2 percent nationally. The number of
methamphetamine-related federal sentences decreased from 59 in FY1997 to 45 in
FY1999, then increased to 63 in FY2001.</p>
<p align="left">In FY2002 methamphetamine prices throughout Arizona varied
depending on the area and level of distribution. The DEA Phoenix Division
reported that in the fourth quarter of FY2002 wholesale quantities of
Mexico-produced methamphetamine sold for $5,000 to $6,000 per pound in Phoenix
and $4,000 to $7,000 per pound in Yuma. (Wholesale prices were unavailable for
northern Arizona). Methamphetamine sold for $425 per ounce in Phoenix, $300 to
$600 per ounce in Yuma, and $500 to $600 per ounce in northern Arizona. Crystal
methamphetamine sold for approximately $9,000 per pound and $600 per ounce in
Phoenix and $900 per ounce in Yuma. (No other prices for crystal methamphetamine
are available.)</p>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine purity levels have increased in recent years.
Arizona law enforcement agencies report that the purity level of powdered
methamphetamine has increased from 20 to 30 percent in 2000 to 25 to 50 percent
in 2002. In addition, the purity level of crystal methamphetamine ranges from 95
to 99 percent.</p>

      <font color="#800000"><a name="Violence">Violence</a></font></h3>
      <p align="left">Violence often is associated with the production, distribution, and abuse of
methamphetamine in Arizona. Methamphetamine-related violence poses a significant
threat to the state. According to the Office of the Arizona Attorney General,
methamphetamine is the illicit drug most commonly associated with violent crime
in Arizona. The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office reports that methamphetamine
production and distribution are the greatest contributors to increasing rates of
violent crime in its jurisdiction. Moreover, of the 36 Arizona law enforcement
respondents to the NDTS 2002 who reported methamphetamine-related violence in
their jurisdictions, 24 reported an increase in the threat posed by
methamphetamine to the safety and security of citizens.</p>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine is a powerful stimulant that affects the central nervous
system and can induce anxiety, insomnia, paranoia, hallucinations, mood swings,
delusions, and violent behavior, particularly during the &quot;tweaking&quot;
stage of abuse. Law enforcement officials throughout the state attribute an
increase in violent crimes such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse,
robbery, burglary, and assault to rising methamphetamine abuse.</p>

feelings of emptiness and dysphoria. During the tweaking stage, the user often
has not slept in days and consequently is extremely irritable. The &quot;tweaker&quot;
also craves more methamphetamine, which results in frustration and contributes
to anxiety and restlessness. At this stage methamphetamine users may become
violent without provocation. Case histories indicate that tweakers have reacted
violently to the mere sight of a police uniform.</p>

      <a name="Production"><font color="#800000">Production</font></a></h3>

<p align="left">Most of the methamphetamine available in Arizona is produced in
Mexico by Mexican DTOs and criminal groups. However, methamphetamine production
occurs in Arizona, although it has been decreasing throughout the state.
According to the EPIC National Clandestine Laboratory Seizure System (NCLSS),
methamphetamine laboratory seizures decreased significantly in recent years.
Federal, state, and local law enforcement authorities in Arizona seized 375
methamphetamine laboratories in 2000, 287 in 2001, and 211 in 2002. According to
HIDTA Methamphetamine Conspiracy Group officials, the decrease in laboratory
seizures may be attributed to the tighter border controls implemented in 2001.
This action has decreased the amount of pseudoephedrine smuggled into Arizona
and resulted in methamphetamine production shifting to Mexico, where
pseudoephedrine and other essential chemicals are more easily attainable. In
addition, law enforcement officials in Arizona report that methamphetamine
abusers in the state prefer high quality crystal methamphetamine produced in
Mexico, rather than locally produced powdered methamphetamine. Many abusers who
had produced methamphetamine are now purchasing the drug from these DTOs instead
of producing it themselves.</p>

<p align="left">Methamphetamine laboratories in Arizona are generally small and
yield ounce quantities of the drug. Most methamphetamine laboratories are
operated by Caucasian criminal groups and independent producers. Mexican DTOs
and criminal groups, OMGs--primarily Hells Angels--and independent Mexican
laboratory operators also produce methamphetamine in the state, but to a lesser
extent. These groups use ephedrine/pseudoephedrine reduction methods to produce
the drug. (See <a href="#Methamphetamine"> Methamphetamine Production Methods text
box</a>.) Most producers of
methamphetamine in Arizona use the iodine/red phosphorus method. The Birch
reduction method of production also is used, but to a much lesser extent.
Further, the DEA Phoenix Division reports that crystal methamphetamine typically
is produced by Caucasian independent producers in small-scale laboratories that
yield an ounce or less of the drug.</p>

remote areas or set up laboratories in locations such as residences, mobile
homes, and motel rooms. However, small-scale producers are increasingly using
mobile methamphetamine &quot;box labs.&quot; Box labs are small in size and
easily dismantled, enabling methamphetamine producers to frequently move
operations in attempts to avoid detection.</p>
<p align="left">Precursor and essential chemicals used in methamphetamine
production contribute to the threat posed by methamphetamine. Methamphetamine
producers obtain ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and other essential chemicals from
Mexican DTOs, although this appears to be occurring somewhat less frequently
than in the past. These DTOs typically smuggle the chemicals through the San
Luis and Nogales POEs in commercial and private vehicles. Laboratory operators
in Arizona also acquire precursor and essential chemicals from criminal groups
and independent dealers operating in California. In addition, ephedrine and
pseudoephedrine commonly are extracted from cold pills and other
over-the-counter medications by laboratory operators; other essential chemicals
such as iodine, lithium, and ether are legally available at commercial
businesses.</p>

            <blockquote>

<p align="left">In January 2002 law enforcement officials dismantled a
pseudoephedrine trafficking network involving more than 100 individuals
nationwide, including 2 Phoenix men. The Chicago-based organization smuggled
pseudoephedrine from Windsor, Ontario, Canada, through Detroit and on to
California. The proceeds from the operation were laundered through two Jordanian
brothers' Chicago car dealerships; some of the money was traced to Jordan and
other Middle Eastern countries. As a result of this investigation, law
enforcement officials seized more than 21 million pseudoephedrine tablets in
California in October and December of 2001.</p>

<p align="left">Methamphetamine production poses serious safety and
environmental concerns to Arizona. The production process creates toxic and
hazardous waste that endangers law enforcement personnel, emergency response
teams, adults and children who reside in or near the homes of methamphetamine
producers, and the environment. Moreover, many precursor chemicals are volatile
and can be extremely dangerous if not handled properly; in several incidents law
enforcement officials have discovered laboratories because of explosions that
resulted from improper chemical handling.</p>

      <h3>
      <a name="Transportation"><font color="#800000">Transportation</font></a></h3>
    <p align="left">Mexican DTOs and criminal groups smuggle methamphetamine
    into Arizona primarily from Mexico. The drug also is transported into the
    state from California and Nevada, but to a lesser extent. OMGs, Caucasian
    criminal groups, and Caucasian and Mexican independent dealers also
    transport methamphetamine throughout the state. The Nogales and San Luis
    POEs are primary entry points for methamphetamine smuggled into Arizona from
    Mexico. The percentage of Arizona POE methamphetamine seizures occurring at
    these two POEs increased from 66 percent in 2000 to 100 percent in 2002.</p>
    <p align="left">Methamphetamine typically is smuggled from Mexico into
    Arizona in private and commercial vehicles. The drug also is smuggled into
    the state by pedestrians, couriers aboard buses and aircraft, and package
    delivery services. Traffickers employ a variety of concealment methods to
    smuggle methamphetamine into Arizona, particularly when using vehicles.
    Concealment locations in vehicles include seats, gas tanks, quarter panels,
    dashboards, air cleaners, and headlights.</p>
    <p align="left">Most of the methamphetamine smuggled into Arizona from
    Mexico is transported through the state to areas throughout the country.
    Traffickers commonly use state routes and less-traveled roads to transport
    methamphetamine from the border region to Interstates 10 and 40 in Arizona.
    Once on I-10 and I-40, traffickers transport methamphetamine to primary
    market areas throughout the country. Operation Pipeline data for 2001
    indicate that Arizona law enforcement officials seized 48 pounds of
    methamphetamine in 14 highway interdictions; 5 occurred on I-40. The largest
    seizure occurred west of Flagstaff on I-40, where law enforcement officials
    seized 20.7 pounds of methamphetamine that had been hidden in the gas tank
    of a private vehicle.</p>

      <h3>
      <a name="Distribution"><font color="#800000">Distribution</font></a></h3>
    <p align="left">Mexican DTOs and criminal groups dominate wholesale
    methamphetamine distribution in Arizona. Caucasian criminal groups,
    Caucasian and Mexican independent dealers, OMGs, and Hispanic street gangs
    also distribute methamphetamine at the wholesale level throughout the state.
    Law enforcement officials have identified Phoenix and Tucson as major
    methamphetamine distribution areas in Arizona.</p>
    <p align="left">Caucasian and Mexican criminal groups, Caucasian and Mexican
    local independent dealers, OMGs, Hispanic street gangs, and prison gangs
    dominate retail-level methamphetamine distribution in the state. Retail
    dealers frequently purchase methamphetamine from Mexican DTOs and criminal
    groups that typically are located in the urban areas of Arizona. Most
    retail-level methamphetamine distribution occurs through street sales and in
    private residences. However, OMGs typically distribute methamphetamine
    through selected retail distributors, members of smaller associated
    motorcycle gangs, and female associates who work in OMG-owned businesses
    such as bars and strip clubs.</p>
    <p align="left">Retail methamphetamine distributors vary by location
    throughout the state. In the Phoenix area, Caucasian and Mexican independent
    dealers dominate retail methamphetamine distribution. In Maricopa County
    OMGs such as Hells Angels and Huns and independent dealers distribute
    methamphetamine at the retail level. The Gilbert Police Department reports
    that Hells Angels and the Mexican Mafia prison gang distribute
    methamphetamine at the retail level in its jurisdiction. Law enforcement
    officials in Flagstaff and Yavapai County report that Hells Angels members
    are involved in retail methamphetamine distribution in their areas. Tucson
    Police Department officials report that Caucasian independent dealers and
    OMGs, including Hells Angels and Devils Diciples, distribute methamphetamine
    in their city.</p>

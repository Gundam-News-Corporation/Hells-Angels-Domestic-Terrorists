	  <p align="center"><strong>ATF UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATION LEADS TO FEDERAL  RACKETEERING INDICTMENT AND ARREST OF 61 MEMBERS OF SO. CAL.-BASED MONGOLS OUTLAW  MOTORCYCLE GANG</strong> </p>
	  <p align="left"><em>LOS ANGELES</em> &ndash; Sixty-one members of the violent Mongols outlaw motorcycle  gang were arrested today after being named in an 86-count federal racketeering  indictment that alleges the criminal enterprise was involved in a wide range of  criminal activity, including murder, hate crimes against African-American,  assaults, firearms violations and narcotics trafficking.</p>
	  <p align="left">As part of the racketeering indictment that charges 79  defendants, 10 people linked to the gang were arrested previously on various  firearms, narcotics and assault charges. A total of 71 defendants have now been  taken into federal custody as a result of the three-year investigation.</p>
	  <p align="left">The racketeering indictment seeks the forfeiture of the  trademarked &ldquo;Mongols&rdquo; name, which is part of the &ldquo;patch&rdquo; members wear on their  motorcycle jackets.</p>
	  <p align="left">&ldquo;In addition to pursuing the criminal charges set forth in  the indictment, for the first time ever, we are seeking to forfeit the  intellectual property of a gang,&rdquo; said United States Attorney Thomas P.  O&rsquo;Brien. &ldquo;The name &lsquo;Mongols,&rsquo; which is part of the gang&rsquo;s &lsquo;patch&rsquo; that members  wear on their motorcycle jackets, was trademarked by the gang. The indictment  alleges that this trademark is subject to forfeiture. We have filed papers  seeking a court order that will prevent gang members from using or displaying  the name &lsquo;Mongols.&rsquo; If the court grants our request for this order, then if any  law enforcement officer sees a Mongol wearing his patch, he will be authorized  to stop that gang member and literally take the jacket right off his back.&rdquo;</p>
	  <p align="left">Those arrested today include the former Mongols National  President Ruben &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Cavazo, several chapter presidents, and various officials  of local chapters. In addition to the arrests today, authorities seized dozens  of motorcycles which allegedly are part of the gang&rsquo;s criminal enterprise.</p>
	  <p align="left">During the investigation into the Mongols, the ATF, joined by  investigators from the Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, the Montebello  Police Department and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, seized 71  firearms, an explosive device and narcotics, including more than six pounds of  methamphetamine.</p>
	  <p align="left">A total of 162 search warrants were executed today in  California, Nevada, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Florida and Ohio. In addition  to the motorcycles seized today, authorities recovered numerous firearms. </p>
	  <p align="left">The Mongols are an outlaw motorcycle gang that was formed in  Montebello, California in the 1970s. There are as many as 600 members  nationwide, with approximately 400 based in Southern California. Many of the  Mongols were recruited from some of the most violent Los Angeles-area street  gangs, including the &ldquo;Avenues&rdquo; and &ldquo;18th Street.&rdquo; </p>
	  <p align="left">The Mongols have been in an escalating battle with the Hells  Angels motorcycle gang since 2002 when the two groups engaged in a massive riot  at a casino in Laughlin, Nevada. The Mongols have also been involved in an  ongoing and violent feud with the Mexican Mafia over Mongols drug trafficking  activities in areas controlled by the Mexican Mafia.</p>
	  <p align="left">According to the indictment, members of the Mongols typically  engage in crimes that include acts of violence &ndash; ranging from battery to murder  &ndash; drug trafficking, money laundering, weapons trafficking, extortion, and, very  frequently, violent attacks on African-Americans. Members also frequently  conduct robberies, steal motorcycles, and engage in the theft of credit card  account information to obtain funds for themselves and the organization.  Members often commit their crimes and acts of violence with perceived impunity  because they believe victims and witnesses are afraid to testify against them  or to cooperate with law enforcement for fear of retaliation by the larger  Mongols organization.</p>
	  <p align="left">During the investigation, four male ATF agents worked  undercover and successfully infiltrated the Mongols to become &ldquo;full-patch&rdquo;  members. Four female ATF agents also went undercover to pose as their  girlfriends. The undercover agents had to undergo rigorous scrutiny by the  Mongols, including polygraph examinations, to be accepted as members of the  Mongols. They also had to develop and maintain &ldquo;biker personas&rdquo; to prolong  their undercover investigation. </p>
	  <p align="left">ATF Special Agent in Charge John Torres said: &ldquo;Today, the  leadership of the Mongols, one of the most violent outlaw motorcycle gangs, was  taken down. For three years, four brave and dedicated ATF undercover agents put  their lives on the line to infiltrate the Mongols. They made great personal  sacrifices to protect our community and we are all extremely grateful.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
	  <p align="left">Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca stated: &quot;This is  another example of a unified law enforcement effort that has brought down  members of a notorious outlaw gang.&nbsp; This  investigation has made our streets safer&quot;.</p>
	  <p align="left">Captain Al Salinas, of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police  Department&rsquo;s Organized Crime Bureau, commented: &ldquo;Today, members of the Las Vegas  Metropolitan Police Department, along with the Henderson and North Las Vegas  Police Departments, in conjunction with federal agents executed numerous arrest  and search warrants throughout the Vegas Valley.&nbsp;These warrants were the  culmination of an investigation which began more than three years ago into  outlaw motorcycle gang criminal activity which impacted the Vegas  community.&nbsp;We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to  keep our neighborhoods safe.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
	  <p align="left">Those arrested today are expected to make their initial  appearances this afternoon in United States District Court. Most of the  defendants were arrested in the Los Angeles area, meaning that they will be  brought to federal court in downtown Los Angeles to appear before one of four  United States Magistrate Judges who will determine if bond should be set for a  particular defendant.</p>
	  <p align="left"><em>An indictment contains allegations that a defendant has  committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty</em>.</p>
	  <p align="left">The investigation into the Mongols motorcycle gang was  conducted by agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives (ATF); the Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department; the Montebello  Police Department; and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. In addition  to the United States Attorney&rsquo;s Office in Los Angeles, federal prosecutors in  Las Vegas, San Diego, Denver and Reno have worked on the case.</p>
	  <p align="left">The following agencies  participated in this morning&rsquo;s takedown, providing valuable resources to  conclude this investigation: California Highway Patrol, United States Marshals  Service, Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation, the Whittier Police  Department, the West Covina Police Department, the Los Angeles County  Department of Children and Family Services, the San Bernardino County Sheriff&rsquo;s  Department, the Glendale Police Department, the Bell Gardens Police Department,  the Los Angeles Police Department, the Irwindale Police Department, the Baldwin  Park Police Department, the Azusa Police Department, the Pomona Police  Department, the Ventura County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office and the Riverside County  Sheriff&rsquo;s Department.</p>

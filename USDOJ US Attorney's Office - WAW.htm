        <p>DEVRON D. QUAST, 38, of Abbotsford, British Columbia, pleaded guilty today in   U.S. District Court in Seattle to Conspiracy to Distribute Cocaine and Marijuana   and Conspiracy to Engage in Money Laundering. QUAST was arrested in June 2008,   following a three year investigation that involved undercover officers and   resulted in the seizure of more than 1,700 pounds of cocaine, 7,000 pounds of BC   Bud and about $3.5 million. QUAST faces a mandatory minimum ten years in prison   and up to life in prison when sentenced by Chief U.S. District Judge Robert S.   Lasnik on March 6, 2009. QUAST’s plea agreement states that he intends to apply   for treaty transfer to Canada immediately following his sentencing. QUAST had   been held at the Federal Detention Center at Sea-Tac since his arrest.</p>
        <p>According to records filed in the case, drugs were hidden inside hollowed out   logs on trucks, within the false walls of cargo containers and vehicles, within   loads of commercial lumber and beauty bark, inside large PVC pipes, and within   the interior of a propane tanker. Some loads were carried on foot across the   international border between the United States and Canada. QUAST oversaw the day   to day operations of the drug transportation, even providing insurance to the   Canadian marijuana suppliers that drugs would be successfully smuggled into the   U.S. While involved at a high level in the drug conspiracy, QUAST was employed   as General Manager at his father’s car dealership, Don Quast Hyundai.</p>
        <p>On the day QUAST was arrested with co-defendant Robert L. Shannon, law   enforcement seized an additional $60,000 and hundreds of pounds of BC Bud that   the ring was attempting to traffick into the U.S. QUAST and Shannon had come to   Ferndale to meet with the undercover officer in connection with the drug   deal.</p>
        <p>Other defendants who have entered guilty pleas include: <br />
          Phillip W. Stone,   45, Abbotsford, British Columbia, who obtained containers and trailers to   transport BC Bud into the U.S. pleaded guilty to Conspiracy to Distribute   Cocaine and Marijuana on November 17, 2008, and is scheduled to be sentenced on   February 13, 2009.<br />
          John H. Fairweather pleaded guilty to Conspiracy to   Distribute Cocaine and Marijuana on October 16, 2008, and is scheduled to be   sentenced January 19, 2009.<br />
          Chance Gerrior, 42, Arlington, Washington,   allowed his property to be used to store marijuana. PGerrior pleaded guilty   October 9, 2008, to Misprision of a Felony and is scheduled to be sentenced   January 9, 2009.<br />
          Korinne Doggett, 42, Arlington, Washington, allowed   marijuana to be stored at her home. On October 1, 2008, she pleaded guilty to a   misdemeanor charge of Possessing a Controlled Substance. Dogget is scheduled to   be sentenced December 10, 2008.</p>
        <p>These defendants are all scheduled for trial on February 23, 2009, in front   of Chief U.S. District Judge Robert S. Lasnik:</p>
        <p>Robert J. Shannon, 38, of Maple Ridge, British Columbia, who was allegedly in   charge of distributing the narcotics on behalf of the Hells Angels Outlaw   Motorcycle gang and others.<br />
          Richard Jansen, 33, Chilliwack, British Columbia,   owner of Scorpion Transport Services, allegedly assisted the organization by   driving his trucks across the border to facilitate future smuggling.<br />
          Jesse   Holmes, 64, Blaine, Washington, allegedly provided a Bellingham warehouse where   the drug organization stored loads of marijuana.<br />
          Todd Gabriel, 41, Everett,   Washington allegedly delivered loads of marijuana in western Washington and   California.</p>
        <p>To date, 40 defendants have been charged in connection with the   investigation. Twelve of them are Canadian. Some of the defendants are from as   far away as Iowa, Illinois, and Ontario, Canada, </p>
        <p>This was an Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF)   investigation, providing supplemental federal funding to the federal and state   agencies involved. This investigation was lead by U.S. Immigration and Customs   Enforcement (ICE), with significant support from the Drug Enforcement   Administration (DEA), and the Snohomish Regional Drug Task Force.</p>
        <p>The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Douglas   Whalley and Special Assistant United States Attorney Adam Cornell. Mr. Cornell   is a Deputy Snohomish County Prosecutor specially designated to prosecute drug   cases in federal court.</p>
        <p>For additional information please contact Emily Langlie, Public Affairs   Officer for the United States Attorney’s Office, at (206) 553-4110.</p>

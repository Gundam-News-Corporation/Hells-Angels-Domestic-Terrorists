      <p align="left">Methamphetamine is a principal drug threat to Nebraska,
      primarily because of the drug's ready availability and the harmful
      physical and environmental effects associated with its abuse and
      production. Law enforcement agencies throughout the state report that the
      level of methamphetamine availability in their jurisdictions is high. Many
      also reported the presence of methamphetamine laboratories in their areas,
      as well as an adverse environmental impact from the laboratories.
      Methamphetamine produced by Mexican criminal groups in Mexico, California,
      and southwestern states is the predominant type available in Nebraska.
      Methamphetamine produced in the state is also available, and seizures of
      small-scale methamphetamine laboratories have increased. Caucasian local
      independent producers using the Birch reduction method are the primary
      in-state methamphetamine producers. Mexican criminal groups transport
      methamphetamine from Mexico, California, and southwestern states into
      Nebraska in private and commercial vehicles. These criminal groups also
      are the primary wholesale distributors of methamphetamine in Nebraska.
      Mexican criminal groups, Caucasian local independent dealers, street
      gangs, and OMGs distribute retail quantities of methamphetamine from
      residences, parking lots, or business establishments. Violence associated
      with methamphetamine distribution and abuse is a concern within the state.

<p align="left">Law enforcement officials in Nebraska report that
methamphetamine abuse is a significant problem throughout the state. According
to the National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) National Drug Threat Survey
2002, all Nebraska respondents who reported methamphetamine abuse in their
jurisdictions (18) indicated that abuse was at a high level.</p>

              <blockquote>

<p align="left">The National Drug Threat Survey (NDTS) 2002 was administered by
NDIC to a representative sample of state and local law enforcement agencies
throughout the United States to assess the availability, abuse, and overall
threat posed by all major drugs. NDIC received 2,906 survey responses from law
enforcement agencies, an overall response rate of 80 percent. Survey respondents
were asked to rank the greatest drug threats in their areas and to indicate the
level of availability and abuse for each major drug type. They also were asked
to provide information on specific groups involved in the transportation and
distribution of illicit drugs. Responding agencies also provided narrative
assessments of various aspects of the overall drug situation and the threat
posed by specific drugs in their areas. Survey responses are used by NDIC to
substantiate and augment drug threat information obtained from other federal,
state, and local law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p align="left">The number of methamphetamine-related treatment admissions to
publicly funded facilities more than doubled from 1997 through 2001. TEDS data
indicate that methamphetamine-related treatment admissions in Nebraska increased
from 567 in 1997 to 1,294 in 2001. In addition, there were more treatment
admissions for abuse of methamphetamine than for abuse of any other illicit drug
in 2000 and 2001. (See <a href="overview.htm#Table 1"> Table 1</a> in Overview section.)</p>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine has been a factor in drug deaths in the Omaha
metropolitan area. According to Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) mortality
data, the number of methamphetamine-related deaths in the Omaha metropolitan
area fluctuated from 1997 through 2001; seven deaths were reported in 1997, five
in 1998, three in 1999, seven in 2000, and eight in 2001. (See <a href="#Mortality"> text

enforcement officials throughout Nebraska report that methamphetamine
availability is high. According to NDTS 2002, all of the 18 Nebraska law
enforcement respondents who reported on methamphetamine availability in their
jurisdictions indicated that availability was high. Methamphetamine produced in
Mexico, California, and southwestern states is the predominant type available in
Nebraska; however, the availability of locally produced methamphetamine is
increasing. Crystal methamphetamine, commonly known as ice, also is available in
the state. The South Sioux City Police Department occasionally seizes small
quantities of crystal methamphetamine, and in September 2001 the Nebraska State
Patrol seized 2 pounds of crystal methamphetamine on I-80.</p>

<p align="left">The ready availability of methamphetamine in Nebraska also is reflected in
seizure data. According to Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Federal-wide
Drug Seizure System (FDSS) data, federal law enforcement officials in Nebraska
seized 33 kilograms of methamphetamine in 1998, 14 kilograms in 1999, 32
kilograms in 2000, and 48 kilograms in 2001. (See <a href="#Table 3">Table 3</a>.) Law enforcement
authorities that reported to Operation Pipeline seized over 5 kilograms of
methamphetamine in 1999 and more than 23 kilograms in 2000. State and local
seizures of methamphetamine also are significant. The Omaha Metro Task Force,
composed of nine agencies (FBI, IRS, NSP, Douglas County Sheriff's Office, Omaha
Police Department, Sarpy County Sheriff's Department, La Vista Police
Department, Papillion Police Department, and Bellvue Police Department), seized
over 76 kilograms in 2000 and more than 38 kilograms in 2001. The Nebraska State
Patrol seized 30 kilograms of methamphetamine in 2001.</p>

<p align="left">The percentage of drug-related federal sentences that were
methamphetamine-related in Nebraska in FY2001 was nearly five times the national
percentage. According to USSC data in FY2001, 66 percent of drug-related federal
sentences in Nebraska were methamphetamine-related--the second highest rate in
the nation. (See <a href="overview.htm#Table 2"> Table 2</a> in Overview section.) The number of sentences for
methamphetamine-related offenses in Nebraska increased dramatically from 51 in
FY1997 to 185 in FY2001. Only four states--California, Texas, Iowa, and
Missouri--had a higher number of methamphetamine-related sentences in FY2001.</p>
<p align="left">Prices for methamphetamine in Nebraska vary by location and amount sold. In
2003 methamphetamine sold for $3,500 to $8,000 per pound throughout Nebraska.
Ounce prices were as low as $300 in Grand Island and as high as $1,200 in Omaha.
The Nebraska State Patrol in North Platte reported that methamphetamine sold for
$65 to $85 per gram. Throughout Nebraska, prices for Mexico- and locally
produced methamphetamine were approximately the same.</p>
<p align="left">The purity of methamphetamine in Nebraska varies depending on its origin and
level of distribution. For example, in 2002 the Omaha Police Department reported
that locally produced methamphetamine had a higher retail purity level--75 to 90
percent--than methamphetamine produced in Mexico, California, and southwestern
states. According to the Grand Island Police Department and the Tri-City Drug
Task Force, the retail purity level of Mexican source methamphetamine decreased
from an average of 55 percent in 1997 to 14 percent in 2000, 11 percent in 2001,
and less than 10 percent in 2002. The reason for this significant decline in
purity is not known.</p>

<p align="left">The potential for violence resulting from methamphetamine abuse
is a concern within the state. Individuals addicted to methamphetamine are
unpredictable and often violent, endangering themselves and others. These users
are most dangerous during the tweaking stage, the point at which the euphoric
effects of methamphetamine diminish. Methamphetamine abusers often are paranoid
and delusional and frequently arm themselves against perceived threats.
According to ADAM data, almost 10 percent of adult men arrested in Omaha for
violent offenses in 2000 tested positive for methamphetamine.</p>

enter the tweaking stage in which they are prone to violence, delusions,
paranoia, and feelings of emptiness and dysphoria. During the tweaking stage,
the user often has not slept in days and, consequently, is extremely irritable.
The &quot;tweaker&quot; also craves more methamphetamine, which results in
frustration and contributes to anxiety and restlessness. In this stage the
methamphetamine user may become violent without provocation. Case histories
indicate that tweakers have reacted negatively at the mere sight of a police
uniform.</p>

<p align="left">Violence associated with methamphetamine distribution also is a
concern in Nebraska. Methamphetamine distributors sometimes commit violent
crimes to protect their territory. Street gangs that distribute methamphetamine
have reportedly committed aggravated assault, drive-by shooting, and homicide.
Respondents to the NDIC National Gang Survey 2000 reported that the following
gangs distribute methamphetamine and commit violent crimes in Nebraska: East
Side Locos in Grand Island; 18th Street, Bloods, Crips, Gangster Disciples, and
Lomas 13 in Lincoln; and Sureños 13 in Omaha.</p>

<p>Mexican criminal groups using the hydriodic acid/red phosphorus reduction
method in high volume laboratories in Mexico, California, and southwestern
states produce most of the methamphetamine available in Nebraska. (See <a href="#Methamphetamine"> text
box</a>.) Local independent producers, most of whom are Caucasians, also produce
methamphetamine in Nebraska, but to a lesser extent. They use the Birch
reduction method to produce gram and ounce quantities of methamphetamine for
personal use and for limited distribution to friends and associates. In Cass
County Hispanic local independent dealers with ties to street gangs in Omaha,
particularly the Lomas street gang, also produce methamphetamine.</p>

<p>Methamphetamine laboratory seizures in Nebraska are increasing. According to
the EPIC National Clandestine Laboratory Seizure System, there were 41
methamphetamine laboratories seized in Nebraska in 2000 and 133 in 2001.
Laboratory seizures include operational laboratories as well as
chemicals/glassware/equipment and dumpsites. The Nebraska State Patrol seized
213 methamphetamine laboratories, dumpsites, or chemicals and glassware
statewide in 2001 (some of these seizures may have been reported to EPIC). The
Omaha Metro Task Force seized 21 methamphetamine laboratories in 2000 and 36
laboratories in 2001. In Plattsmouth--a city with 7,500 residents located south
of Omaha in Cass County--police seized more than 50 laboratories or dumpsites in
2000, earning the city the nickname &quot;Plattsmeth.&quot; Most methamphetamine
laboratories are relatively small, rudimentary, and portable, making detection a
challenge for law enforcement authorities. In Nebraska law enforcement
authorities seize laboratories from apartments and homes, hotel rooms, vehicles,
and abandoned barns and farmhouses.</p>
<p>Chemicals used in methamphetamine production are readily available in
Nebraska. Anhydrous ammonia often is stolen from farms and farm supply outlets.
Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine can be extracted from diet pills and many
over-the-counter cold medicines using coffee filters, coffeepots, tabletop
grills, and microwave ovens. Iodine can be purchased at local feed stores, and
lithium often is extracted from camera batteries. In Omaha law enforcement
authorities have asked store clerks at convenience stores, gas stations, and
grocery stores to limit the sale of common household items such as cold
medicines containing ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, gasoline additives, rubbing
alcohol, drain cleaner, distilled water, lye, and coffee filters in an effort to
help curb the illegal use of such items by methamphetamine producers.</p>
<p>The Birch reduction method of methamphetamine production is common in
Nebraska, as well as in most other agricultural states, because of the wide
availability of anhydrous ammonia, which is legitimately used as a fertilizer.
Methamphetamine abusers in Otoe County refer to locally produced methamphetamine
as Annie because it is produced with anhydrous ammonia using the Birch reduction
method. In an attempt to curb anhydrous ammonia diversion, the state legislature
enacted a law in September 2001 that makes it illegal for a person to possess
anhydrous ammonia with the intent to produce methamphetamine.</p>
<p>The iodine/red phosphorus method is used less frequently to produce
methamphetamine in Nebraska. Red phosphorus laboratories have been seized in
Cass, Nance, and Platte Counties and Columbus, Fremont, and South Sioux City.</p>
<p>Methamphetamine production creates serious safety and environmental concerns.
The production process creates toxic and hazardous waste that endangers law
enforcement personnel, emergency response teams, children (particularly those in
the homes of methamphetamine producers), and the environment. The chemicals used
in the production process are toxic, highly flammable, and yield poisonous
vapors. Production of 1 pound of methamphetamine yields approximately 5 to 7
pounds of toxic waste. Methamphetamine laboratory operators often dump chemicals
in areas accessible to the public. These chemicals contaminate soil, streams and
rivers, and public sewer systems. Remediation of laboratory sites costs federal,
state, and local governments millions of dollars every year. The average cost of
cleaning one site is $5,000; however, costs can exceed $100,000 for larger
sites.</p>

      <p align="left">Mexican criminal groups are the primary transporters of
      methamphetamine into Nebraska. These groups transport the drug from
      Mexico, California, and southwestern states in hidden compartments in
      private and commercial vehicles. U.S. Highways 77 and 81 frequently are
      used to transport the drug to the eastern half of Nebraska. Law
      enforcement authorities report that Mexican criminal groups transport
      methamphetamine from Mexico and California to Fremont. In addition,
      Mexican criminal groups in Michoacan and Juarez as well as Sinaloan
      Cowboys in Mexico and in Modesto and Los Angeles, California, transport
      methamphetamine to South Sioux City. Typically, Mexican criminal groups
      that supply methamphetamine to Lincoln transport the drug through
      Albuquerque, New Mexico, and cities in Colorado including Denver, Fort
      Collins, and Greeley, and then travel eastward along I-80. Members of
      Hispanic street gangs--18th Street, Florencia, Sureños 13, and Lomas--transport
      methamphetamine obtained from associates in Southern California to the
      Omaha area for distribution.</p>
      <p align="left">Hispanic immigrants, primarily Mexican nationals who have
      relocated to Nebraska seeking employment in the meatpacking industry, are
      heavily recruited by Mexican criminal groups to transport methamphetamine.
      Cities in Nebraska where meatpacking operations are located such as Grand
      Island, Lexington, Lincoln, Omaha, and South Sioux City have become
      primary destinations for methamphetamine produced in Mexico, California,
      and southwestern states. In South Sioux City Mexican criminal groups also
      recruit Native Americans from the Omaha and Winnebago Reservations as
      couriers. Transporters and distributors affiliated with Mexican criminal
      groups frequently hide on reservation property to avoid detection by law

      <p align="left">Nebraska is a transit area for methamphetamine intended
      for distribution in other states. Law enforcement officials in Nebraska
      indicate that methamphetamine bound for Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and
      Michigan is transported through Nebraska on I-80. In September 2000 the
      Nebraska State Patrol searched a private vehicle heading east on I-80 and
      seized 19 pounds of methamphetamine hidden in the speaker compartment. The
      vehicle was en route from Los Angeles to Minneapolis.</p>

<p align="left">Mexican criminal groups are the primary wholesale distributors
of methamphetamine in the state. Mexican criminal groups provide wholesale
quantities of methamphetamine to distributors--often Hispanic immigrants working
in meatpacking plants--whom they recruit. These distributors blend easily with
the large Hispanic population that has been drawn to the state because of
employment opportunities in the meatpacking industry. Caucasian local
independent dealers also distribute methamphetamine at the wholesale level in
Nebraska, but to a lesser extent. Law enforcement officials in Beatrice and
Sidney identified Caucasian local independent dealers as wholesale distributors
of methamphetamine in those jurisdictions.</p>

              <blockquote>

<p align="left">In 2002 law enforcement authorities in McCook reported that they
had identified a Mexican criminal group that transported 60 to 100 kilograms of
Mexico-produced methamphetamine to a wholesale distributor in Grand Island each
month. The wholesale distributor supplied pound quantities of methamphetamine to
retail distributors in the McCook and Lincoln areas. The retail distributors in
turn sold ounce quantities of the drugs to users in their areas.</p>

<p align="left">Law enforcement respondents to the NDTS 2002 in Omaha and
Lincoln reported that Mexican criminal groups and local independent dealers
distribute methamphetamine at the retail level in their areas. Also in Lincoln
some Vietnamese and Laotian independent dealers distribute methamphetamine at
the retail level, while in Omaha Hispanic gangs such as Sureños 13, 18th
Street, Florencia, and Lomas serve as retail distributors of the drug. Street
gangs such as Must Be Criminals in Omaha and West Side Locos in South Sioux
City--which are multiethnic gangs composed of Caucasian and Hispanic
members--also distribute methamphetamine at the retail level. Caucasian local
independent dealers distribute retail quantities of locally produced
methamphetamine throughout the state. Members of the Hells Angels OMG distribute
methamphetamine to close associates. Retail distribution of methamphetamine in
Nebraska typically occurs in residences, parking lots, or business
establishments such as bars, strip clubs, and taverns.</p>

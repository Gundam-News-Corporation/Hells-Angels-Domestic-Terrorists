    <p align="left"><font FACE="Times">Methamphetamine production and abuse are spreading to
    rural areas in the Southern and Central Districts of Illinois from bordering
    states such as Missouri, Iowa, and Indiana. Methamphetamine is growing in
    popularity because it has a lower cost and longer euphoric effect than crack
    cocaine. Methamphetamine abuse is not common in the Chicago area.
    Methamphetamine production is a serious safety and environmental concern in
    Illinois. (See <font color="#FF00FF"> <a href="appendix.htm#Top"> Appendix</a></font> 
    for responses to the NDIC National Drug Threat
    Survey 2000.) Mexican DTOs transport methamphetamine into Illinois from
    California and other Southwest Border states.</font></p>
    <b>
    <h3 align="left"><a name="Abuse"><font color="#800000">Abuse</font></a></h3>
    </b>
    <p align="left"><font FACE="Times">Methamphetamine abuse is increasing throughout rural
    areas of Illinois. Law enforcement agencies in the Central and Southern
    Districts of Illinois report that methamphetamine abuse is on the rise. Methamphetamine abuse is highest in the Central and Southern Districts of
    the state, according to the Illinois OASA. Methamphetamine's lower cost
    and longer euphoric effect have attracted some crack users, adding to the
    user population. Young people, also attracted to the drug's euphoric
    effects, are increasingly using methamphetamine at rave parties.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font FACE="Times">Methamphetamine abuse is not common in the Chicago
    area. Indicators for Chicago showed no substantial increases in the
    availability and abuse of methamphetamine through the beginning of 2000.
    Chicago area law enforcement believes that the relative scarcity of
    methamphetamine in the area is a result of the abundance of cocaine.
    Methamphetamine may not have affected Chicago drug markets severely because
    African-American street gangs are more entrenched in the crack markets in
    their communities. Only two small pockets of methamphetamine abusers have
    been identified in the Chicago area since 1998, one on the North Side and
    the other near the Indiana state line.

    <p align="left">Methamphetamine availability and production are increasing in Illinois.
    Methamphetamine now poses the primary drug threat in the rural areas of the
    state and is the second most serious threat after crack in urban areas of
    central Illinois. The rate of increase in the number of methamphetamine
    laboratories in Illinois parallels previous increases in other states in the
    region. The number of laboratory seizures in these other states has
    increased significantly. Illinois State Police statistics for the third
    quarter of 1999 reveal that there were 77 methamphetamine encounters in 41
    Illinois counties, a 208 percent increase from the third quarter of 1998
    when 25 encounters were reported in 5 counties. Encounters are defined as
    abandoned or active methamphetamine laboratories, anhydrous ammonia thefts,
    dealer arrests, and methamphetamine purchases or seizures. The Illinois
    State Police expect to seize more than 400 methamphetamine laboratories in
    2000, nearly double the number seized in 1999. This increase is due, in
    part, to law enforcement agencies from Missouri and Iowa aggressively
    pursuing methamphetamine cookers through targeted legislation, prompting
    them to relocate.</p>

    methamphetamine production equipment in the southern Illinois town of
    Harrisburg. Found in their possession was material used to produce
    methamphetamine, including a propane torch, latex gloves, batteries, crushed
    ephedrine, and drain cleaner. The men were first observed near an anhydrous
    ammonia storage tank.</p>

    <p align="left">Some urban areas such as Rockford, which is supplied by
    small laboratory operators in western Illinois, report increased
    availability of methamphetamine. Methamphetamine abuse is rising in areas
    surrounding Chicago, where Mexican criminal groups are transporting
    methamphetamine along with other drugs. With the exception of Chicago and
    the Metro-East area where Mexican-produced methamphetamine predominates, the
    methamphetamine available to the rest of Illinois is produced in small
    laboratories in the state.</p>
    <p align="left">According to DEA, methamphetamine prices in Chicago range from $7,300 to
    $10,000 per pound (see <a href="#Table 7">Table 7</a>), considerably less

    </b><font FACE="Times">
    <p align="left">The potential for violence associated with methamphetamine is
    significant. Individuals addicted to methamphetamine are unpredictable and
    will go to great lengths to obtain the drug. Methamphetamine users
    experience feelings of paranoia, fright, and confusion, and as a result, may
    become violent. Methamphetamine users are often paranoid and delusional and
    frequently arm themselves against perceived threats. They may become violent
    without provocation. In 1998, two men in Albion, Illinois, who were high
    from a nonstop, 1-week binge on methamphetamine, went on a shooting spree
    that left five people dead in two states. The victims included a Mennonite
    farmer, shot as he worked in his fields, and a mother of four, killed after
    they hijacked her car.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    </font><b>
    <h3 align="left"><a name="Production"><font color="#800000">Production</font></a></h3>
    </b><font FACE="Times">
    <p align="left">Most methamphetamine is produced in high-volume clandestine laboratories
    in Mexico and in California. Smaller laboratories, already established in
    surrounding states, are emerging in Illinois. Although it is not very common
    in northern Illinois, most methamphetamine in the area is shipped from
    California, Missouri, and Iowa.</p>
    <p align="left">Law enforcement agencies in the Southern and Central Districts report
    that the production of methamphetamine is increasing in rural and
    residential areas of Illinois. Laboratory operators are primarily lower- and
    middle-income Caucasians who function independently and produce relatively
    small quantities of methamphetamine. In response to the growing
    methamphetamine problem, four major Illinois state laws regarding
    methamphetamine possession, manufacturing, and precursor chemicals went into
    effect in January 2000.</p>
    <p align="left">Increased thefts of the fertilizer anhydrous ammonia point to an increase
    in methamphetamine production in the Central and Southern Districts. Most of
    the methamphetamine laboratories seized in Illinois involve the Nazi
    production method. Anhydrous ammonia, which produces a hazardous and
    volatile environment, is used in the Nazi method to speed the production of
    methamphetamine. According to DEA, most anhydrous ammonia thieves are
    addicted to methamphetamine and are willing to go to great lengths to obtain
    the ammonia, which they sell or exchange for methamphetamine. Law
    enforcement agencies report a wave of anhydrous ammonia thefts from farms
    and supply outlets in the Central and Southern Districts. Farmers store
    anhydrous ammonia as a liquid under pressure in large tanks in their fields.
    Thieves remove locks from tanks with bolt cutters and use garden or vacuum
    hoses to siphon the ammonia from the tanks. Since the tanks can hold as much
    as 100,000 gallons, thefts--often of as little as a gallon or two--frequently
    go undetected.</p>
    <p align="left">Methamphetamine production is a serious safety and environmental concern.
    The production process creates toxic and hazardous waste that endangers law
    enforcement personnel, emergency response teams, and the environment.
    Methamphetamine laboratories may contain a variety of highly flammable toxic
    chemicals and vapors. Clandestine laboratories produce 5-6 pounds of toxic
    waste for every pound of methamphetamine produced. Most toxic residue from
    methamphetamine production is dumped in the local area, contaminating
    groundwater and killing vegetation. In Adams County, methamphetamine cookers
    are gathering all the necessary equipment and precursors and cooking on
    rural, gravel roads and leaving waste in ditches. Government agencies spend
    millions of dollars every year to clean up laboratory sites.</p>

    <p align="left">Mexican DTOs are transporting methamphetamine into Illinois from
    California and Mexico. DEA offices in Wyoming report that cities there have
    become transit centers for multipound quantities of methamphetamine shipped
    from California to Chicago. Seizures of methamphetamine from private
    vehicles driven from California and Texas to Illinois have become more
    common over the past 2 years. In June 1998, the California Highway Patrol
    seized 13.4 kilograms of methamphetamine from two Mexican males during a
    traffic stop in Placer County, California. The suspects were en route to
    Chicago from San Francisco. In October 1998, a California man was indicted
    on federal drug charges after officers of the Kansas State Patrol seized
    approximately 12 kilograms of methamphetamine concealed in hidden
    compartments in his 1985 Jaguar. The suspect was stopped for speeding while
    traveling from California to Chicago. In 1999, there were several seizures
    of methamphetamine destined for Chicago from California. For example, an
    Operation Valkyrie stop in Illinois resulted in the seizure of 2.5 kilograms
    of methamphetamine, and in San Bernardino County, California, 17.2 kilograms
    were seized--both shipments were destined for Chicago. According to the
    Chicago HIDTA, methamphetamine from California is also being shipped to
    Illinois via the mail and other package delivery services.</p>

      U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and Border
      Patrol agents seized 31 kilograms of methamphetamine from a 1995 Mercury
      Grand Marquis at the checkpoint on U.S. Highway 281, 13 miles south of
      Falfurrias, Texas. The 29 bundles of suspected Mexico-produced
      methamphetamine, wrapped in brown tape, were found in a compartment hidden
      above the gas tank in the front section of the trunk. Several bundles had
      the letters &quot;CH&quot; written on them. Inside the vehicle was a map
      that showed a route to Illinois with Chicago circled. A 45-year-old male
      and a 43-year-old female, both Mexican national residents of Reynosa,
      Tamaulipas, Mexico, were arrested.</font></p>

    <p align="left">Methamphetamine is also transported from Mexico to Illinois through
    other states on the Southwest Border. For example, two Mexican nationals
    were arrested in Texas in May 2000 with 31 kilograms of methamphetamine
    secreted in a private automobile being driven to Chicago. Methamphetamine
    transported to Chicago from the Southwest Border area is usually not
    consumed in the city but is transshipped to rural areas of Illinois and to
    other states in the region. In August 1998, an individual was arrested and
    charged with supplying 8 kilograms of methamphetamine from Chicago to users
    in Kalamazoo, Michigan.</p>
    <p align="left">Methamphetamine produced in clandestine laboratories in Illinois and
    surrounding states is transported in private vehicles throughout the region
    via the highway system. Increased law enforcement pressure in Missouri is
    forcing methamphetamine laboratory operators to relocate to rural parts of
    western Illinois, where the methamphetamine is produced and transported back
    to Missouri for sale.</p>

    chapter maintains a self-governing hierarchy that normally consists of a

    <p align="left">The HAMC traffics in methamphetamine, cocaine, marijuana, LSD, heroin,
    PCP, MDMA, and steroids. In addition to its drug trafficking activities, the

    Hispanic street gangs are becoming involved in methamphetamine distribution
    from Illinois to surrounding states. Three members of the Chicago-based
    Latin Kings were sentenced in June 2000 for their roles in a multistate
    methamphetamine distribution operation. The methamphetamine, along with
    cocaine and marijuana, was shipped from Mexico to Illinois for distribution
    in Illinois and Michigan. Although outlaw motorcycle gangs, primarily the
    Hells Angels, remain active in retail distribution, they no longer control
    wholesale distribution of methamphetamine.</p>

    the retail distribution of methamphetamine in Illinois. The primary users of
    methamphetamine in Illinois are whites in rural areas of the state.
    Methamphetamine sales at the retail level take place predominantly in rural
    areas where most consumption takes place. While a relatively large quantity
    of Mexico-produced methamphetamine transits Chicago, there is little
    evidence that it is being sold at the retail level there.</font>

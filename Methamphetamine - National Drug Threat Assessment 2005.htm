              <li>
<p align="left">Law enforcement reporting as well as laboratory seizure and 
arrest data indicates that methamphetamine availability has increased over the 
past year in the Northeast Region, particularly in rural areas. For example, 
National Clandestine Laboratory Seizure System (NCLSS) data show that the number 
of reported methamphetamine laboratory seizures in the Northeast region 
increased from 94 in 2002 to 143 in 2003. DEA methamphetamine-related arrests 
also have increased recently in the Northeast Region from 179 in 2002 to 198 in 
2003. Law enforcement reporting indicates that the increase in methamphetamine 
availability in the Northeast Region is due primarily to a significant increase 
in wholesale distribution by Mexican criminal groups. Nevertheless, 
methamphetamine availability in the Northeast remains lower than in any other 
region of the country.</li>
              <li>
<p align="left">The availability of ice methamphetamine has increased in the 
past year because of an increase in ice production and distribution by Mexican 
criminal groups; however, this form of the drug is not as widely available in 
the United States as powder methamphetamine.</li>
              <li>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine production appears to have increased sharply in 
Mexico since 2002 because Mexican criminal groups producing the drug in the 
United States are having greater difficulty obtaining bulk quantities of 
pseudoephedrine from Canada. However, Mexican criminal groups have greater 
access to bulk quantities of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine from China for use in 
Mexico-based laboratories.</li>
              <li>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine smuggling from Mexico into the United States via 
Arizona appears to have increased sharply since 2001. More methamphetamine was 
seized at or between POEs in Arizona in 2003 than at or between POEs in 
California or Texas.</li>

      <h3 align="left"><font color="#800000"><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a> 
      and Trends</font></h3>
    <p align="left">The threat posed to the United States by the trafficking and 
    abuse of methamphetamine is high and increasing. Methamphetamine 
    availability, production, and distribution are increasing nationally; 
    however, national-level data do not indicate a clear trend--either 
    increasing or decreasing--with respect to rates of methamphetamine use. 
    Nevertheless, demand for the drug is relatively high. In fact, NSDUH 2003 
    data indicate that more than 1.3 million persons aged 12 or older used 
    methamphetamine within the past year in 2003.</p>
    <p align="left">According to state and local law enforcement agencies, the 
    threat associated with methamphetamine trafficking and abuse has increased 
    sharply since 2002 and now exceeds that of any other drug. NDTS data show 
    that the percentage of state and local law enforcement agencies that 
    identify methamphetamine as the greatest drug threat in their areas has 
    increased from 31 percent in 2002, to 36.2 percent in 2003, and 39.6 percent 
    in 2004. NDTS 2004 data further indicate that, for the first time, the 
    percentage of state and local agencies that identify methamphetamine as 
    their greatest drug threat (39.6%) surpassed that of cocaine (35.6%), 
    including crack, and is much higher than marijuana (12.0%), heroin (8.6%), 
    or MDMA (0.6%).</p>
    <p align="left">According to state and local law enforcement agencies, 
    methamphetamine-related criminal activity has increased concurrently with 
    the rise in the overall threat posed by the trafficking and abuse of the 
    drug. NDTS data show that the percentage of state and local law enforcement 
    agencies that identify methamphetamine as the drug that most contributes to 
    violent crime increased from 31.6 percent in 2003 to 34.2 percent in 2004. 
    Similarly, the percentage of state and local law enforcement agencies that 
    identify methamphetamine as the drug that most contributes to property crime 
    increased from 29.8 percent to 32.7 percent during the same period.</p>
    <p align="left">The attendant dangers occasioned by domestic methamphetamine 
    production to individuals, property, and the environment contribute to the 
    overall threat posed by the drug. Law enforcement personnel, first 
    responders, clandestine laboratory operators, and those in proximity to 
    laboratories, particularly children, often are injured as a result of 
    chemical burns, fires, and explosions at clandestine laboratories. In fact, 
    EPIC NCLSS data show that despite a decrease in the number of reported fires 
    and explosions at methamphetamine laboratory sites (from 396 in 2002 to 361 
    in 2003), the number of reported law enforcement officers injured when 
    responding to methamphetamine laboratories increased from 129 to 255 during 
    the same period.</p>
    <p align="left">The environmental damage caused by improper storage and 
    disposal of chemicals and chemical waste attendant to methamphetamine 
    production is severe, and the cost of soil and structure remediation at 
    contaminated methamphetamine production sites is significant. For example, 
    the annual expenditure for domestic clandestine laboratory (predominantly 
    methamphetamine laboratory) remediation by DEA has increased from $2 million 
    in fiscal year (FY) 1995, to $12.2 million in FY1999, and $16.2 million in 
    FY2003.</p>
    <p align="left">Child neglect and abuse are common within families whose 
    parents or caregivers produce or use methamphetamine. According to the 
    Department of Justice Office for Victims of Crime, children who reside with 
    methamphetamine users are more likely to experience neglect as well as 
    physical, sexual, and mental abuse. Furthermore, children who are present in 
    homes where methamphetamine laboratories also are present often sustain 
    injuries, including skin lesions, chemical burns, and respiratory damage due 
    to drug or chemical exposure. For example, NCLSS 2003 data show that 66 
    percent (589 of 893) of the children reported present at seized 
    methamphetamine laboratory sites subsequently tested positive for toxic 
    levels of chemicals in their bodies.</p>

<h4 align="left"><font color="#800000"><b>Availability</b></font></h4>

<p align="left">Methamphetamine availability has increased in the Northeast Region over the 
past year. All five DEA Field Divisions (Boston, New York, Newark, Philadelphia, 
and Washington D.C.) and five HIDTAs (Appalachia, New England, New York/New 
Jersey, Philadelphia/Camden, and Washington/Baltimore) in the Northeast Region 
report that methamphetamine availability has increased--one of the Field 
Divisions (Washington, D.C.) and the Appalachia HIDTA describe the increase as 
significant. Increasing methamphetamine availability in the Northeast Region 
also is indicated by data that show increases in the number of DEA arrests as 
well as OCDETF investigations and indictments in the region. According to DEA, 
the number of arrests for methamphetamine increased from 179 in 2002 to 198 in 
2003. Similarly, the number of methamphetamine-related OCDETF case initiations 
in the Northeast Region increased from 2 in FY2002 to 12 in FY2003. The 
proportion of OCDETF indictments in which methamphetamine was charged increased 
from less than 1.0 percent in FY2002 to 12.0 percent in FY2003. Moreover, NCLSS 
data show that the number of reported methamphetamine laboratory seizures in the 
Northeast Region increased from 94 in 2002 to 143 in 2003.</p>

<p align="left"><i>NDIC Comment</i>: Anecdotal law enforcement reporting indicates that the 
increase in methamphetamine availability in the Northeast Region is due 
primarily to a significant increase in wholesale distribution by Mexican 
criminal groups. According to DEA, Mexican criminal groups are the predominant 
wholesale distributors of methamphetamine in the region, and their presence in 
the region is increasing, particularly in Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. 
Law enforcement reporting also indicates that methamphetamine availability in 
the Northeast is being augmented significantly by a sharp increase in 
methamphetamine production within the region, particularly by individuals 
producing small quantities of the drug (usually ounce quantities per cook) in 
low capacity laboratories. NCLSS data indicate that the number of reported 
methamphetamine laboratory seizures in the Northeast Region increased from 94 in 
2002 to 143 in 2003.</p>

<h4 align="left"><font color="#800000">Demand</font></h4>
<p align="left">National-level drug prevalence data indicate that rates of past year use for 
powder methamphetamine have fluctuated but decreased overall since 1999; 
however, the number of treatment admissions for methamphetamine has increased 
sharply over the same period. According to TEDS data for 2002, the number of 
methamphetamine treatment admissions to publicly funded drug treatment 
facilities increased from 58,795 in 1999, to 66,975 in 2000, to 81,799 in 2001, 
and 104,481 in 2002.</p>

<p align="left"><i>NDIC Comment</i>: More individuals have independently sought treatment for 
methamphetamine; however, criminal justice referrals account for the greatest 
percentage of the increase. In fact, the percentage of treatment admissions for 
methamphetamine that were the result of criminal justice referrals now appears 
to account for most treatment admissions for methamphetamine (52.6%)--a rate 
much higher than for cocaine (26.1%) or heroin (13.0%). TEDS data indicate that 
the proportion of treatment admissions for abuse of methamphetamine/amphetamine 
(primarily methamphetamine) resulting from individuals requesting treatment 
increased from 26.8 percent in 1999 to 27.3 percent in 2000, but has since 
decreased to 26.0 percent in 2001 and 24.0 percent in 2002. Over the same 
period, the proportion of treatment admissions for methamphetamine/amphetamine 
based on criminal justice referrals decreased from 45.6 percent in 1999 to 45.0 
percent in 2000 but then increased to 47.8 percent in 2001 and 52.6 percent in 
2002.</p>

<h4 align="left"><font color="#800000">Production</font></h4>
<p align="left">There are no conclusive estimates regarding methamphetamine production in 
Mexico; however, methamphetamine production appears to have increased sharply in 
Mexico since 2002. According to DEA, Mexican criminal groups, particularly those 
based in Colima, Michoacán, Jalisco, and Nayarit, have increased the number and 
size of methamphetamine laboratories they operate in Mexico. Supporting the 
assertion of increased methamphetamine production in Mexico is an increase in 
the amount of methamphetamine seized in Mexico and at land POEs along the 
Southwest Border. Data from the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report 
(INCSR) indicate that the amount of methamphetamine reported seized in Mexico 
increased from 400 kilograms in 2001, to 457 kilograms in 2002, and 652 
kilograms in 2003. Furthermore, 2003 EPIC data show that the amount of 
methamphetamine seized along the Southwest Border increased from 1,130 kilograms 
in 2002, to 1,733 kilograms in 2003, and 1,168 kilograms through July 2004.</p>

<p align="left"><i>NDIC Comment</i>: Mexican criminal groups appear to be producing greater 
quantities of methamphetamine in Mexico for distribution in the United States 
because they have greater access in Mexico to bulk quantities of precursor 
chemicals, particularly ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. According to law 
enforcement reporting, Mexican criminal groups purchase bulk quantities of 
pseudoephedrine tablets, often more than 1 ton per shipment, from sources in 
China. Law enforcement reporting further indicates that many of the laboratories 
established during the past 2 years in Mexico are capable of producing 
multihundred-pound quantities of methamphetamine per production cycle. By 
comparison, NCLSS data indicate that the largest reported methamphetamine 
laboratory seized in the United States in 2003 was capable of producing 50 
pounds per production cycle.</p>

<h4 align="left"><font color="#800000">Transportation</font></h4>

      <p align="left">Drug seizure data indicate that methamphetamine smuggling from Mexico into 
the United States via the Arizona-Mexico border appears to have increased 
significantly. The amount of methamphetamine seized at or between Arizona POEs 
has increased from 168 kilograms in 2001, to 313 kilograms in 2002, and 640 
kilograms in 2003. In fact, the amount of methamphetamine seized at or between 
POEs in Arizona in 2003 exceeded seizures at or between POEs in California (593 
kg), Texas (484 kg), and New Mexico (16 kg).</p>

<p align="left"><i>NDIC Comment</i>: The sharp increase in the amount of methamphetamine seized 
at or between POEs in Arizona is more likely an indication of an overall 
increase in methamphetamine smuggling from Mexico into the United States than a 
shift in smuggling routes in favor of Arizona POEs rather than California, New 
Mexico, or Texas POEs. EPIC data show that since 2002--the year law enforcement 
reporting indicates methamphetamine production began to increase significantly 
in Mexico--methamphetamine seizures at or between POEs in California and Texas 
increased sharply, although not to the extent of the increases in Arizona. From 
2002 to 2003 seizures at or between POEs in California and Texas increased from 
478 to 593 kilograms and from 305 to 484 kilograms, respectively. 
Methamphetamine seizures at or between POEs in New Mexico were much lower than 
the other states along the U.S.-Mexico border in 2002 (33.53 kg) and 2003 (16.15 
kg).</p>

<h4 align="left"><font color="#800000">Distribution</font></h4>

<p align="left">Ice methamphetamine distribution has increased significantly since 2001 in 
many of the largest domestic methamphetamine markets. Anecdotal law enforcement 
reporting indicates that ice distribution has increased sharply in Honolulu, 
Houston, Denver, Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, and 
St. Louis since 2001. In some methamphetamine markets ice is now considered the 
preferred form of the drug, supplanting powder methamphetamine as the 
predominant type. For example, DEA and HIDTA reporting indicate that ice 
methamphetamine now is the type most often distributed locally in Phoenix and 
San Diego, two of the Primary Market Areas for methamphetamine.</p>

<p align="left"><i>NDIC Comment</i>: Ice distribution has increased in these cities because of a 
sharp increase in ice production and distribution by Mexican criminal groups 
seeking the higher profit margins associated with ice distribution. The costs 
associated with ice production are slightly higher than those of powder 
methamphetamine, and ice production requires greater knowledge and experience; 
accordingly, ice methamphetamine often is sold at prices much higher than those 
of powder methamphetamine (see <a href="#Table 5">Table 5</a>).</p>

      <h3><a name="Availability"><font color="#800000">Availability</font></a></h3>


<p align="left">There are no conclusive estimates as to the total amount of 
methamphetamine available in the United States because of limitations in 
laboratory and drug seizure data and unsubstantiated or unknown laboratory 
capacity estimates in source areas. However, in attempting to quantify the 
amount of methamphetamine available in the United States, the interagency 
Methamphetamine Availability Working Group established an estimated range of 
120.2 to 167.4 metric tons of pure methamphetamine in 2001, the only year for 
which such data are available. These estimates are derived from analysis of 
limited data and, as such, have a high degree of uncertainty.</p>
<p align="left">Powder methamphetamine is the predominant type available in the 
United States, and law enforcement reporting as well as drug survey data 
indicates that, nationally, powder methamphetamine availability is increasing. 
Every HIDTA and 20 of 21 DEA Field Divisions report increasing availability of 
powder methamphetamine. According to DEA and HIDTA reporting, powder 
methamphetamine is readily available throughout the Pacific, Southwest, and West 
Regions as well as in most areas of the Midwest. Law enforcement reporting also 
indicates that the drug's availability has increased significantly in the 
Southeast to the point that methamphetamine is now readily available in many 
areas throughout the region. Availability also has increased notably in the 
Northeast Region, where the drug previously was unavailable or available only in 
limited amounts.</p>
<p align="left">The availability of ice methamphetamine has increased in the 
past year, but overall this form of the drug is not as widely available in the 
United States as powder methamphetamine. Of the 21 DEA Field Divisions, 19 
report that ice methamphetamine is available and that availability is 
increasing. Similarly, 14 HIDTAs report that ice methamphetamine is increasing 
in their areas. DEA and HIDTA reporting further indicate that in Arizona and 
northern California as well as in some areas of Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Los 
Angeles, and Seattle, ice methamphetamine has supplanted powder methamphetamine 
as the predominant type available.</p>
<p align="left">The availability of methamphetamine tablets produced in Asia 
(primarily Burma) appears to be very limited; such tablets are available 
primarily in northern California. According to DEA, individuals of Hmong and 
Laotian ethnicity in northern California receive methamphetamine tablets from 
Burma for personal use and for limited distribution. However, there are no data 
available to establish reliable estimates as to the amount of Burma-produced 
methamphetamine tablets available in the United States.</p>
<p align="left">NDTS data indicate that methamphetamine availability has 
increased significantly over the past 3 years. The percentage of state and local 
law enforcement agencies reporting methamphetamine availability as high or 
moderate in their areas increased from 58.8 percent in 2002, to 64.6 percent in 
2003, and 65.0 percent in 2004. In 2004 low methamphetamine availability was 
reported by 28.7 percent of agencies, and only 4.7 percent reported that 
methamphetamine was not available in their areas. Regionally, the highest 
percentage of agencies that reported high or moderate methamphetamine 
availability in 2004 was in the Pacific Region (99.0%), followed by the West 
(98.5%), Southwest (89.4%), Southeast (78.7%), Midwest (63.5%), and Northeast 
Regions (23.2%).</p>
<p align="left">The amount of methamphetamine seized annually has fluctuated 
since 2001, but the data may suggest an increase in the availability of 
Mexico-produced methamphetamine. According to FDSS, the amount of 
methamphetamine seized by federal agencies decreased significantly from 4,050 
kilograms in 2001 to 2,475 kilograms in 2002, but then increased sharply to 
3,845 kilograms in 2003. Of the methamphetamine seized since 2001, EPIC data 
show that an increasing amount was seized at or between POEs along the Southwest 
Border, an indication of increased smuggling of Mexico-produced methamphetamine 
into the United States. For example, EPIC data show that the combined amount of 
methamphetamine seized at or between POEs in Arizona, California, New Mexico, 
and Texas decreased slightly from 1,214 kilograms in 2001 to 1,130 kilograms in 
2002 but has since increased sharply to 1,733 kilograms in 2003 and 1,168 
kilograms through July 2004.</p>
<p align="left">DEA data regarding methamphetamine-related arrests show 
significant decreases overall since 2000; however, the data support anecdotal 
law enforcement reporting and survey data that indicate methamphetamine 
availability is increasing in the Northeast Region. DEA arrests for 
methamphetamine-related offenses decreased steadily from 7,700 in 2000 to 4,595 
in 2003 (see <a href="#Figure 15">Figure 15</a>). This decline is due 
primarily to a shift in DEA strategy to arrest fewer but higher priority 
targets. Despite the decrease nationally, however, methamphetamine-related 
arrests have increased recently in the Northeast Region from 179 in 2002 to 198 
in 2003, suggesting an increase in methamphetamine availability in that region, 
although the number of DEA methamphetamine-related arrests in the Northeast 
remains much lower than in other regions (see <a href="#Figure 16">Figure 16</a>).</p>

<p align="left">National-level drug purity data indicate that average 
methamphetamine purity has increased sharply since 2001, particularly because of 
increased availability of high purity ice methamphetamine. According to DEA, the 
average purity of methamphetamine samples tested increased from 40.0 percent in 
2001, to 43.8 percent in 2002, and 57.4 percent in 2003.</p>
<p align="left">There are no national-level data regarding average prices for 
powder methamphetamine, and therefore the only available data are not a reliable 
independent indicator of rising or falling availability of the drug. According 
to DEA, price ranges for wholesale (pound) and midlevel (ounce) quantities of 
powder methamphetamine have expanded since 2001. However, the price range for 
retail (gram) quantities was the same in both 2001 and 2003, despite a rise in 
price in 2002 (see <a href="#Table 6">Table 6</a>).</p>

        </center>

<p>Powder methamphetamine is the most common form of the drug in 
the United States. Clandestinely produced powder methamphetamine is crystalline 
in texture, bitter-tasting, soluble in water, and is produced in several colors 
including white, pink, red, tan, and brown, depending on the production method 
employed. Powder methamphetamine usually is injected or snorted but also can be 
ingested orally or smoked.</p>
<p>Ice methamphetamine is a highly pure, very addictive form of 
methamphetamine resembling shards of ice or chunks of rock salt. Produced 
primarily in Guam, Hawaii, and Mexico, ice is the product of the process of 
recrystallizing powder methamphetamine in a solvent such as water, methanol, 
ethanol, isopropanol, or acetone to remove impurities. Ice typically is smoked 
using either a glass pipe, an empty aluminum can, a piece of aluminum foil, or a 
light bulb.</p>
<p>Methamphetamine tablets are produced primarily in Burma and 
usually contain a combination of powder methamphetamine and caffeine. 
Methamphetamine tablets found in the United States typically are green or 
orange-red in color, imprinted with a variety of symbols (most commonly WY or 
R), and are approximately the size of a pencil eraser. Methamphetamine tablets 
typically are ingested orally and often are flavored and scented like candy 
(grape, orange, or vanilla). Tablets also are smoked by placing the tablet on a 
piece of aluminum foil and passing a heat source under the foil until the tablet 
melts and vapors (which are inhaled) are released. Methamphetamine tablets also 
can be crushed and snorted or mixed with water and injected.</p>

<p align="left">National-level rates of use for methamphetamine are lower than 
those for many illicit drugs primarily because the drug is largely unavailable 
to significant portions of the population, such as those in the Northeast (the 
most populous region in the country) and in large cities such as Chicago, 
Detroit, and Miami. According to 2003 NSDUH data, the rate of past year use for 
methamphetamine among persons aged 12 or older (0.6%) was lower than that for 
marijuana (10.6%), cocaine (2.5%), and MDMA (0.9%) but higher than for heroin 
(0.1%).</p>

<p align="left"><b>Predominant User Groups</b></p>

<p align="left">National drug prevalence data regarding rates of use for 
methamphetamine among various age groups are mixed and do not clearly indicate a 
predominant age group for methamphetamine use. For example, NSDUH 2003 data 
indicate that the rates of past year use for methamphetamine were much higher 
among young adults aged 18 to 25 (1.6%) than among adolescents aged 12 to 17 
(0.7%) or adults 26 or older (0.4%). However, MTF 2003 data indicate that the 
rates of past year use for methamphetamine among tenth (3.3%) and twelfth 
graders (3.2%) are higher than rates among young adults aged 19 to 28 (2.7%) or 
college students aged 19 to 22 (2.6%). As is typical of most illicit drugs, the 
lowest rates of past year use for methamphetamine (2.5%) were reported by eighth 
graders.</p>
<p align="left">Males are slightly more likely to use methamphetamine than 
females; however, at younger ages, females appear to use methamphetamine at 
higher rates than males. According to NSDUH 2003 data, the rate of past year use 
for methamphetamine among males was 0.7 percent compared with 0.4 percent for 
females. But MTF data for 2003 show that rates of past year methamphetamine use 
were higher among eighth and tenth grade females than males. Among all other age 
groups, past year use was higher among males than females (see
<a href="#Table 8">Table 8</a>).</p>

              supplies are limited.</p>
              <p><b>Iodine/hypophosphorous acid</b>. The principal chemicals are 
              ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, iodine, and hypophosphorous acid. 
              The required hydriodic acid in this variation of the hydriodic 
              acid/red phosphorus method is produced by the reaction of iodine 
              in water with hypophosphorous acid. Known as the hypo method, this 
              method results in a high yield of d-methamphetamine and usually is 
              used only when the producer is unable to acquire red phosphorus, 
              although it can be used also when hydriodic acid is in limited 
              supply. The iodine/hypophosphorous acid method is particularly 
              dangerous, often resulting in fires and explosions because of 
              phosphine gas produced during the methamphetamine production 
              process.</p>
              <p><b>Birch</b>. The principal chemicals are ephedrine or 
              pseudoephedrine, anhydrous ammonia, and sodium or lithium metal. 
              Also known as the Nazi method, the Birch method typically yields 
              ounce quantities of high quality d-methamphetamine and typically 
              is used by independent producers.</p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#800000"><b>Phenyl-2-propanone</b></font></p>
              <p><b>P2P</b>. The principal chemicals are phenyl-2-propanone, 
              aluminum, methylamine, and mercuric chloride. This method yields 
              lower quality dl-methamphetamine, has been associated with outlaw 
              motorcycle gangs (OMGs), and is commonly referred to as the P2P

              <blockquote>

<p align="left">On July 1, 2004, two New Mexico State laws that are intended to 
reduce methamphetamine production and the exposure of children to 
methamphetamine laboratory hazards went into effect. The first, House Bill (HB) 
112, allows for a child abuse charge against anyone who exposes a child to the 
production of a controlled substance or allows a child to enter or remain in any 
building containing chemicals and equipment used to produce a controlled 
substance. Suspected violators will be charged with a third-degree felony on the 
first offense and a second-degree felony on the second or subsequent offense. If 
such exposure results in bodily harm or death of the child, the individual will 
be charged with a first-degree felony. The second law, HB 111, provides the 
Board of Pharmacy with the authority to add substances to the list of drug 
precursors and increases penalties for possession, manufacture, or 
transportation of drug precursors without a license from a misdemeanor to a 
fourth-degree felony on the first offense.</p>

      <h4><b><font color="#800000">Domestic Production</font></b></h4>

<p align="left">Domestic methamphetamine production occurs in clandestine 
laboratories that range in capacity from a few ounces to 50 pounds per 
production cycle. Low capacity laboratories are operated throughout the United 
States primarily by local independent methamphetamine users; the number of such 
laboratories appears to be increasing. Large-scale laboratories that yield bulk 
quantities of methamphetamine are typically operated by Mexican criminal groups 
in California.</p>
<p align="left">NDTS data indicate expanding methamphetamine production. 
According to NDTS 2004 data, 49.6 percent of state and local law enforcement 
agencies nationwide describe the level of methamphetamine production in their 
areas as high or moderate, up slightly from 48.8 percent in 2003. At the same 
time, the percentage of agencies reporting that methamphetamine is not produced 
in their areas decreased from 23.2 percent in 2003 to 21.5 percent in 2004. A 
much higher percentage of agencies in the Pacific (76.1%), Southwest (75.1%), 
West (74.3%), and Southeast Regions (67.1%) report high or moderate 
methamphetamine production in their areas than agencies in the Midwest (46.4%) 
or Northeast (9.9%) Regions.</p>
<p align="left">NCLSS data also indicate widespread domestic methamphetamine 
production. According to NCLSS, methamphetamine laboratory seizures were 
reported in 46 states in 2003; more laboratory seizures were reported in the 
Midwest Region (3,038) than in the Southeast (2,847), Southwest (1,874), Pacific 
(1,460), West (820), or Northeast Regions (143). NCLSS data further show that 
there has been a steady increase in the number of reported laboratory seizures 
since 1999 (see <a href="#Figure 23">Figure 23</a>) and that reported 
seizures increased in eastern states but decreased in many western states. From 
2002 to 2003 the number of reported methamphetamine laboratory seizures 
increased in the Southeast (1,906 to 2,847), Midwest (2,540 to 3,038), and 
Northeast Regions (94 to 143) but declined in the Pacific (1,738 to 1,460) and 
West Regions (1,078 to 820).</p>

      </blockquote>
<p align="left">Reported seizures of high capacity superlabs, those capable of 
producing 10 or more pounds of methamphetamine per production cycle, have 
decreased, likely contributing to the decline in total methamphetamine 
laboratory seizures in western states. NCLSS data show that reported seizures of 
superlabs decreased sharply from 246 in 2001, to 144 in 2002, and 133 in 2003. 
Despite declines in reported laboratory seizures in the Pacific, most seizures 
of superlabs still occur in that region, particularly in California. Of the 133 
reported superlab seizures in 2003, 128 were reported in California.</p>
<p align="left">Law enforcement reporting and laboratory seizure data indicate 
that most superlabs in California are controlled by California- and Mexico-based 
criminal groups and are located in southern and central California. According to 
Los Angeles HIDTA reports, four southern California counties (Los Angeles, 
Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino) accounted for 55.8 percent (475 of 851) 
of the reported methamphetamine laboratory seizures in California in 2003 
including 43.0 percent (55 of 128) of reported superlab seizures. The Central 
Valley HIDTA reports that nine central California counties (Fresno, Kern, Kings, 
Madera, Merced, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Tulare) accounted for 
20.6 percent (175 of 851) of the reported methamphetamine laboratory seizures in 
California including 42.9 percent (55 of 128) of reported superlab seizures.</p>
<p align="left">HIDTA reporting indicates that Mexican criminal groups, some 
based in the Los Angeles area, often travel to rural or remote areas of southern 
and central California to produce methamphetamine, subsequently returning to the 
Los Angeles area to distribute the drug. Many of the groups maintain close 
family and social ties with individuals in Culiacán and Michoacán, Mexico, to 
recruit laboratory workers who come to California for a few months to produce 
methamphetamine and then return to Mexico.</p>

<p align="left">On February 7, 2004, agents from the Stanislaus Drug Enforcement 
Agency, California Multijurisdictional Methamphetamine Enforcement Team, and 
Central Valley HIDTA arrested five Mexican nationals and seized an operational 
methamphetamine laboratory located in a residence in Modesto. Authorities had 
received information that several men who were staying at the residence had 
acquired large amounts of chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamine. Agents 
observed the residence for about a week and, after observing several men taking 
supplies commonly used to produce methamphetamine into the residence, obtained a 
search warrant. Shortly after the warrant was obtained, agents observed a 
suspect loading garbage bags into the backseat of his car before leaving the 
residence. The suspect was followed until he was away from the residence, when 
officers stopped his vehicle. A search of the vehicle revealed two garbage bags 
containing 80 pounds of ephedrine. The driver was arrested and charged with 
manufacturing methamphetamine and possession of a controlled substance for sale. 
After his arrest, agents prepared to serve the search warrant on the residence. 
Just prior to entering the residence, four suspects were observed fleeing. Three 
suspects were captured, arrested, and charged with manufacturing 
methamphetamine, criminal conspiracy, and resisting arrest. The fourth suspect 
was found in a trailer located on the property; he was arrested and charged with 
manufacturing methamphetamine, criminal conspiracy, battery on a police officer, 
and resisting arrest. Inside the residence agents found evidence of 
methamphetamine manufacture in every room. They seized over 300 gallons of 
alcohol, 96 pounds of red phosphorus, 80 pounds of ephedrine, and several 
weapons. This laboratory was the largest ever seized in Stanislaus County.</p>

<p align="left">Low capacity laboratories, those capable of producing less than 
1 pound per production cycle, represent an even greater proportion of seized 
laboratories since the number of superlab seizures has declined in recent years. 
For example, low capacity laboratories accounted for 83.4 percent (7,667 of 
9,192) of all seized laboratories in 2002 and 91.3 percent (9,297 of 10,182) in 
2003.</p>
<p align="left">Law enforcement reporting indicates that most methamphetamine 
production in central and eastern states occurs in low capacity laboratories 
operated by independent producers using the Birch or red phosphorus methods. 
NCLSS 2003 data show that of the 6,028 methamphetamine laboratories seized in 
the Midwest, Northeast, and Southeast Regions, 94 percent were small, mobile 
laboratories capable of producing less than 9 ounces of methamphetamine per 
production cycle. Every HIDTA office in the Midwest, Northeast, and Southeast 
Regions, with the exception of the Puerto Rico/U.S. Virgin Islands HIDTA, 
reports that most local methamphetamine production is conducted by local 
independent producers using either the Birch or red phosphorus methods. Only the 
Philadelphia/Camden HIDTA reported that OMGs in its area produce methamphetamine 
via the P2P method as well.</p>

      <h4><font color="#800000">Foreign Production</font></h4>

<p align="left">Law enforcement reporting and seizure data show that 
methamphetamine produced in Mexico and Southeast Asia as well as in Canada is 
available to varying degrees in U.S. drug markets; however, only Mexican 
methamphetamine is smuggled into the United States in quantities adequate for 
national-level distribution. </p>

<p align="left"><b>Mexico</b>. Mexico is the principal source of foreign-produced 
methamphetamine available in the United States. There are no conclusive 
estimates as to the amount of methamphetamine produced in Mexico; however, an 
interagency working group estimated that the amount of Mexico-produced 
methamphetamine seized in the United States was 0.97 metric ton in 2001 and 1.1 
metric tons in 2002, the most recent year for which such data are available. Law 
enforcement reporting indicates that methamphetamine production in Mexico is 
considerable, and there is wide consensus among law enforcement agencies that 
production in Mexico has increased significantly since 2002, yet few data are 
available to confirm this assertion other than an apparent increase in 
methamphetamine seizures at or between land POEs along the Southwest Border (see
<font color="#111111"><a href="#Transportation">Transportation</a></font> section). According to DEA, most 
methamphetamine production in Mexico occurs in the southwestern states of Colima, 
Michoacán, Jalisco, and Guerrero and in the northern states of Baja California 
and Sonora. The hydriodic acid/red phosphorus method is the primary method of 
production in Mexico; however, the P2P method is also commonly used.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Southeast Asia</b>. Southeast Asian criminal groups produce 
large quantities of ice methamphetamine in laboratories located primarily in 
China and, to a lesser extent, the Philippines, Taiwan, and South Korea. 
According to DEA, Chinese criminal groups manufacture multikilogram quantities 
of ice per production cycle in mobile laboratories located in eastern and 
southeastern provinces of China. Most ice produced in China is intended for 
domestic distribution; China-produced ice also supplies drug markets in other 
Asian countries and the United States, particularly in the Philippines, Hawaii, 
and Guam.</p>
<p align="left">Burmese criminal groups are the principal producers of 
methamphetamine tablets in Southeast Asia. Intelligence reports indicate that 
Burmese criminal groups produce several hundred million methamphetamine tablets 
annually for distribution in drug markets in Thailand, China, and India. 
According to DEA, some shipments of methamphetamine tablets from Burma have been 
received by ethnic Hmong and Laotian individuals, primarily in the Sacramento 
area. However, there are no reliable seizure data regarding Burma-produced 
methamphetamine tablets en route to the United States or any reliable estimates 
as to the amount of Burma-produced methamphetamine tablets available in the 
United States. Methamphetamine tablet production also has been reported in 
Malaysia and Fiji; however, there are no estimates as to the amount of 
methamphetamine tablets produced in those countries, nor are there specific 
reports of methamphetamine tablets produced in Malaysia or Fiji available in the 
United States.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Canada</b>. The amount of methamphetamine produced in Canada is 
relatively low compared with the United States; however, production levels in 
Canada may be increasing. According to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), 
the amount of methamphetamine produced in Canada primarily by Canada-based OMGs, 
Asian criminal groups, and independent traffickers is increasing, as evidenced 
by an increase in the number of reported methamphetamine laboratory seizures in 
Canada from 13 in 2001, to 25 in 2002, and 39 in 2003. RCMP reporting also 
indicates that the amount of Canada-produced methamphetamine seized en route to 
the United States has increased since 1998; however, there are no quantifiable 
data to support this assertion. In fact, EPIC data show that the amount of 
methamphetamine seized at or between POEs along the Northern Border is low and 
decreased from 3.3 kilograms in 2002 to 0.2 kilogram in 2003.</p>

<h4 align="left"><font color="#800000"><b>Precursor Chemicals</b></font></h4>

<p align="left">Most operators of high capacity methamphetamine laboratories in 
the United States and Mexico produce the drug by utilizing ephedrine or 
pseudoephedrine, precursor chemicals produced in China, the Czech Republic, 
Germany, Hong Kong, India, Switzerland, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. 
Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are shipped from these production countries 
throughout the world including to the United States, Canada, and Mexico for 
legitimate use. However, some ephedrine and pseudoephedrine is diverted from 
intended legitimate purposes by criminal groups for use in illicit 
methamphetamine production, particularly in California and Mexico.</p>
<p align="left">Since the late 1990s, most operators of domestic superlabs have 
produced methamphetamine using bulk quantities of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine 
tablets diverted from Canada. Middle Eastern (Armenian, Jordanian, Lebanese, 
Syrian, and Yemeni) criminal groups and other individuals based in Canada and 
the United States purchase pseudoephedrine tablets in bulk--often in the 
millions--from legitimate wholesale chemical distributors in Canada and smuggle 
the tablets across the Northern Border in private and commercial vehicles 
through or between land POEs such as Detroit and Port Huron in Michigan. The 
tablets usually are transported to stash sites in the United States before being 
distributed to methamphetamine producers for use in high capacity laboratories, 
particularly those located in central and southern California. Pseudoephedrine 
diversion groups also transport smaller shipments of diverted ephedrine and 
pseudoephedrine from Canada to methamphetamine producers in the United States 
via mail services and, to a lesser extent, couriers on commercial flights.</p>
<p align="left">Recent anecdotal law enforcement reporting indicates that more 
domestic superlabs are producing methamphetamine using ephedrine or 
pseudoephedrine diverted from Asia. According to DEA, recent legislation in 
Canada designed to reduce ephedrine and pseudoephedrine diversion appears to 
have led many methamphetamine laboratory operators in the United 
States--particularly operators of high capacity laboratories--to begin using 
bulk quantities of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine obtained from sources in Asia 
but usually smuggled into the United States via Mexico. Moreover, several law 
enforcement operations have been successful in reducing the 
availability of pseudoephedrine tablets smuggled into the United States from 
Canada. In fact, law enforcement reporting indicates that seizures of 
Asia-produced pseudoephedrine products at methamphetamine superlabs in 
California have increased. For example, the Los Angeles County Regional Criminal 
Information Clearinghouse reports that pseudoephedrine products manufactured in 
Hong Kong have been seized at several clandestine methamphetamine laboratory 
sites in California since 2002. In addition, in February 2004 the Stanislaus 
Drug Enforcement Agency discovered a methamphetamine laboratory with three large 
trash bags containing empty 1,000-tablet bottles of Asia-produced 
pseudoephedrine. Such seizures previously were very uncommon.</p>
<p align="left">Asian pseudoephedrine products also are used at methamphetamine 
laboratories in Mexico. Law enforcement reporting indicates that multiton 
quantities of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are transported each year to Mexico 
and that some are illegally distributed to methamphetamine producers by criminal 
groups. For example, law enforcement reporting indicates that between April 2002 
and July 2004 nearly 80 undocumented shipments of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine 
were transported from Hong Kong to Mexico via the United States, Panama, or 
Europe for subsequent distribution to methamphetamine producers in southwestern 
Mexico.</p>

            <h3><font color="#800000"><a name="Transportation">Transportation</a></font></h3>
           <p>Methamphetamine is transported by numerous criminal groups using 
a wide range of conveyances. Mexican criminal groups, local independent dealers, 
street gangs, OMGs, and Asian criminal groups smuggle methamphetamine into and 
transport it within the United States. Most methamphetamine is transported via 
private vehicles although some, particularly tableted methamphetamine, is 
transported via commercial vehicles, mail services, couriers aboard commercial 
flights, and maritime conveyances.</p>
      <h4><font color="#800000">Routes from Foreign Source Areas</font></h4>

<p align="left">Most methamphetamine transported from foreign sources is 
smuggled into the United States overland via private and commercial vehicles. 
According to EPIC seizure data, the amount of methamphetamine seized at or 
between land POEs from 2001 through 2003 was 4,081 kilograms, compared with 
approximately 85 kilograms seized from commercial flights and 5 kilograms seized 
from maritime conveyances.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Mexico</b>. Mexican criminal groups based in Mexico smuggle bulk 
quantities of methamphetamine via couriers traveling in private and commercial 
vehicles, usually equipped with hidden compartments, or by foot through and 
between land POEs along the Southwest Border. These criminal groups also smuggle 
small shipments (2 kg to 4 kg) via couriers aboard commercial flights and mail 
services. Methamphetamine shipments often are transported to stash sites and 
staging areas, primarily in California and Arizona, before the drug is 
distributed locally, regionally, or nationally.</p>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine transported from production areas in Mexico to 
the Southwest Border typically has been smuggled through and between POEs in 
California; however, recent data indicate that more methamphetamine may now be 
smuggled through or between POEs in Arizona than other Southwest Border states. 
According to EPIC seizure data, the combined amount of methamphetamine seizures 
from 2001 through 2003 at or between POEs in California (1,725 kg) was much 
higher than the amount seized at or between POEs in Texas (1,145 kg), Arizona 
(1,120 kg), or New Mexico (60 kg). However, in 2003 the amount seized in Arizona 
(640 kg) surpassed seizures in the other Southwest Border states including 
California (593 kg), Texas (484 kg), and New Mexico (16 kg) possibly because of 
specific law enforcement operations conducted in Arizona (see
<a href="#Figure 24">Figure 24</a>).</p>

<p align="left">There are seven principal POEs through which methamphetamine is 
smuggled from Mexico into the United States: Calexico, Otay Mesa, and San Ysidro 
in California; Nogales in Arizona; and Hidalgo, Laredo, and Pharr in Texas. EPIC 
seizure data show that from 2001 through 2003 more methamphetamine was seized at 
the San Ysidro POE (845 kg) than any other, although seizures during the same 
period at Nogales (645 kg), Calexico (382 kg), Otay Mesa (195 kg), Laredo (136 
kg), Hidalgo (133 kg), and Pharr (129 kg) were significant.</p>
<p align="left">Once inside the United States, methamphetamine is transported 
from principal POEs to drug markets throughout the country, particularly to the 
Primary Market Areas of Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Diego, and San Francisco.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Southeast Asia</b>. Law enforcement reporting indicates that 
Asian DTOs, including ethnic Cambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, 
Laotian, Thai, and Vietnamese, transport ice methamphetamine to the Pacific 
Region from source countries in Asia via mail services and passengers on 
commercial flights to California and Hawaii. Tableted methamphetamine also is 
transported to the United States from Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and 
Laos, via mail services and couriers on commercial flights. EPIC data show that 
Honolulu, Los Angeles, and San Francisco International Airports are the primary 
POEs for methamphetamine tablets smuggled into the United States. Seizure data 
further show that methamphetamine tablet seizures for 2001 through 2003 combined 
were slightly higher in San Francisco (33,490 tablets) than in Honolulu (33,470 
tablets); seizures in both cities were much higher than in Los Angeles (18,416 
tablets). The Louisville POE in Kentucky reported the most methamphetamine 
tablets seized (111,650) in 2003; however, these tablets were seized in a single 
incident.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Canada</b>. Methamphetamine smuggling from Canada through and 
between POEs along the Northern Border occurs at a very low level, and seizure 
data do not indicate any principal POEs along this border. EPIC data show that 
from 2001 through 2003, less than 4 kilograms of methamphetamine were seized at 
or between POEs along the Northern Border.</p>

      <h4><font color="#800000">Routes from Domestic Source Areas</font></h4>
      <p>California is the only state with methamphetamine production 
sufficient to supply wholesale quantities to regional and national markets. 
Methamphetamine produced in California typically is transported via private 
vehicle to Primary Market Areas and other significant methamphetamine markets 
including those in the central and eastern United States.</p>

      <h3><font color="#800000"><a name="Distribution">Distribution</a></font></h3>

<p align="left">Powder methamphetamine and, increasingly, ice methamphetamine 
are distributed to a varying degree throughout the country. Law enforcement 
reporting indicates that powder methamphetamine distribution is widespread in 
the Midwest, Pacific, Southwest, and West Regions, moderate and increasing in 
the Southeast Region, and limited but increasing in the Northeast Region. Law 
enforcement reporting indicates that Mexican criminal groups control most 
wholesale distribution of powder methamphetamine in the Pacific, Southwest, and 
West as well as in many areas of the Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast Regions 
where wholesale quantities of Mexican methamphetamine are distributed. Mexican 
criminal groups also control most midlevel distribution of powder 
methamphetamine throughout the country, particularly in the Pacific, Southwest, 
and Western Regions, and supply other Mexican criminal groups, OMGs, and 
independent Caucasian and Hispanic midlevel distributors in all regions of the 
country. Retail powder methamphetamine distributors include Caucasian 
independent dealers, Hispanic street gangs, and OMGs; Caucasian independent 
dealers control most retail distribution in rural areas, which often consists of 
distributing small amounts of methamphetamine that they produce.</p>
<p align="left">The distribution of ice methamphetamine, once limited to Guam, 
Hawaii, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Samoa, now is pervasive throughout the 
Pacific and Southwest Regions and in many areas of the Midwest and West Regions. 
Ice distribution is comparatively limited in the Southeast and Northeast but has 
increased in these regions since 2002. California- and Mexico-based Mexican 
criminal groups control most wholesale distribution of ice methamphetamine in 
the United States; however, Asian criminal groups (including ethnic Cambodian, 
Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Thai, and Vietnamese) distribute 
wholesale amounts of the drug to a limited number of drug markets in the Pacific 
Region. Retail ice distributors include Caucasian independent dealers, Hispanic 
street gangs, and OMGs.</p>
      <h4><font color="#800000">Primary Market Areas</font></h4>

<p align="left">Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Diego, and San Francisco are the 
Primary Market Areas for methamphetamine because these cities have very high 
levels of methamphetamine abuse and are among the leading regional- or 
national-level methamphetamine distribution centers. Several other significant 
markets for methamphetamine either exhibit high levels of consumption or serve 
as distribution centers for the drug, although not to the extent of the four 
Primary Market Areas. For example, methamphetamine use in Seattle appears to be 
considerable as evidenced by a high number of ED mentions for methamphetamine; 
however, drug seizure data do not substantiate Seattle as a distribution center 
for methamphetamine at a level comparable with the Primary Market Areas. 
Conversely, Dallas appears to be a significant distribution center for 
methamphetamine based on EPIC drug seizure data; however, methamphetamine 
consumption in Dallas appears to be much lower than in the Primary Market Areas.</p>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine use and distribution are extensive throughout 
the central United States and in many areas of the Southeast; however, the data 
indicate that no city in central or southeastern states has demonstrated a level 
of methamphetamine consumption or distribution comparable with that of the 
Primary Market Areas. Law enforcement agencies in states such as Alabama, 
Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, 
Nebraska, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas report widespread distribution; 
however, this distribution usually entails the sale of small amounts among 
friends and family members who produce methamphetamine in low capacity 
laboratories. To the extent that wholesale methamphetamine distribution occurs 
in these states, it usually involves the distribution by members of Mexican 
criminal groups of methamphetamine produced in Mexico or California superlabs. 
Despite limited data regarding methamphetamine consumption for most of the 
states listed above, the data that are available indicate significantly lower 
use in central and southeastern states than in the Primary Market Areas. For 
example, DAWN data for 2002 show that the number of methamphetamine-related ED 
mentions was much lower for Minneapolis (319), Atlanta (246), St. Louis (150), 
Dallas (98), and Chicago (42) than for Los Angeles (1,713), San Francisco (727), 
San Diego (598), and Phoenix (501).</p>

<p align="left"><b>Los Angeles</b>. Methamphetamine use in Los Angeles is very high 
as evidenced by more ED mentions than any other DAWN reporting city. According 
to DAWN, the estimated number of methamphetamine-related ED mentions for Los 
Angeles (1,713) was much higher than the next highest city, San Francisco (727).</p>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine distribution is pervasive throughout the Los 
Angeles area. According to the Los Angeles HIDTA, 63 of 110 identified criminal 
organizations in the Los Angeles area distribute methamphetamine. Mexican 
criminal groups control most wholesale and midlevel methamphetamine distribution 
within the Los Angeles area and also control most wholesale distribution of the 
drug from Los Angeles to other markets throughout the country. Hispanic street 
gangs including 18th Street, Mara Salvatrucha, and Southside Gang as well as 
prison gangs such as Mexican Mafia control most retail methamphetamine 
distribution in the Los Angeles area; however, local independent dealers also 
distribute the drug at the retail level.</p>
<p align="left">EPIC drug seizure data indicate that Los Angeles is likely the 
largest distribution center for methamphetamine in the United States. Combined 
EPIC Pipeline, Convoy, and Jetway drug seizure data for 2002 and 2003 show that 
law enforcement reported 78 methamphetamine seizure events on domestic highways, 
railways, and at airports in which the Los Angeles area was identified as the 
city of origin for the methamphetamine shipment. Moreover, significantly more 
methamphetamine was seized in 2002 and 2003 that originated in the Los Angeles 
area (259 kg) than any other city. Drug seizure data also show that 
methamphetamine is distributed from the Los Angeles area to other significant 
markets including Atlanta, Denver, Des Moines and Davenport (IA), Kansas City 
(KS), Kansas City (MO), and San Francisco.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Phoenix</b>. Methamphetamine use in Phoenix is high and 
increasing as evidenced by a high number of ED mentions and an increase in 
methamphetamine-related deaths. According to DAWN data for 2002, Phoenix ranked 
fifth among DAWN reporting cities in the estimated number of ED mentions for 
methamphetamine (501) behind Los Angeles (1,713), San Francisco (727), San Diego 
(598), and Seattle (541). DAWN mortality data show that the number of 
methamphetamine-related deaths in Phoenix has increased steadily, more than 
doubling from 60 in 1998 to 132 in <a name="text12">2002</a>.<sup><b><a href="#foot12">12</a></b></sup> Moreover, the 
proportion of methamphetamine-related deaths to all drug-related deaths 
increased from 15.3 percent in 1999 to 25.5 percent in 2002.</p>
<p align="left">Mexican DTOs and criminal groups control most wholesale 
methamphetamine distribution in Phoenix, supplying midlevel and retail 
quantities to Hispanic street gangs such as Wetback Power and Sureños, OMGs such 
as Hells Angels, and Caucasian and Mexican independent dealers. Phoenix-based 
independent producers also distribute retail quantities of the methamphetamine 
that they produce.</p>
<p align="left">EPIC Pipeline, Convoy, and Jetway data indicate that Phoenix is 
a significant distribution center for methamphetamine. Combined EPIC data for 
2002 and 2003 show that law enforcement officials reported 19 methamphetamine 
seizure events in which Phoenix was identified as the city of origin for the 
shipment. Only Los Angeles (78) and San Francisco (22) were identified more 
often than Phoenix as the city of origin for methamphetamine shipments destined 
for domestic drug markets. Furthermore, more methamphetamine was seized in 2002 
and 2003 that originated in Phoenix (69 kg) than any other city with the 
exception of Los Angeles (259 kg). EPIC data indicate that methamphetamine is 
distributed to several significant drug markets in the Midwest, Northeast, and 
Pacific Regions including Akron (OH), Detroit, Kansas City (MO), Las Vegas, 
Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, and Rapid City (SD).</p>

<p align="left"><b>San Francisco</b>. The level of methamphetamine consumption in 
San Francisco is very high compared with most other cities. According to DAWN 
data, the estimated number of methamphetamine-related ED mentions in San 
Francisco increased from 611 in 2001 to 727 in 2002, second only to Los Angeles 
(1,713).</p>
<p align="left">Mexican criminal groups control most wholesale and midlevel 
distribution of powder and ice methamphetamine in San Francisco, although 
Hawaiian, Filipino, and other Asian DTOs control the distribution of the ice 
they produce, particularly within Asian communities. Independent dealers and 
street gangs such as Mara Salvatrucha, 19th Street, Sureños, Trece, and Eddy 
Street Mob are the primary retail distributors of methamphetamine in the San 
Francisco area.</p>
<p align="left">EPIC Pipeline, Convoy, and Jetway drug seizure data show that 
the San Francisco area is among the leading methamphetamine distribution 
centers. Combined EPIC data for 2002 and 2003 indicate that law enforcement 
officials reported 22 powder methamphetamine seizure events on domestic 
highways, railways, and at airports in which the San Francisco area was 
identified as the origin for the methamphetamine shipment. In fact, only Los 
Angeles (78) was identified more often than San Francisco as the city of origin 
for methamphetamine seizure events. Furthermore, more methamphetamine was seized 
that originated in the San Francisco area (54 kg) than any other city, with the 
exception of Los Angeles (259 kg) and Phoenix (69 kg). EPIC seizure data 
indicate that methamphetamine is distributed from the San Francisco area to drug 
markets throughout the country including Anchorage, Des Moines (IA), Dutch 
Harbor (AK), Lihue (HI), Lynn Haven (FL), Memphis, New York, Omaha, Rupert (ID), 
and Sioux City (IA).</p>

<p align="left"><b>San Diego</b>. Methamphetamine use in San Diego is very high. 
According to DAWN, the estimated number of methamphetamine-related ED mentions 
for San Diego (598) was surpassed only by Los Angeles (1,713) and San Francisco 
(727) among DAWN reporting cities in 2002.</p>
<p align="left">Mexican DTOs and criminal groups are the primary wholesale and 
midlevel distributors of methamphetamine in the San Diego area. Street gangs and 
local independent dealers, usually supplied by Mexican criminal groups, control 
most retail distribution; however, independent producers also distribute smaller 
amounts of the methamphetamine they produce.</p>
<p align="left">EPIC Pipeline, Convoy, and Jetway data indicate that San Diego 
is among the leading methamphetamine distribution centers. Combined EPIC data 
for 2002 and 2003 show that law enforcement officials reported 19 powder 
methamphetamine seizure events on domestic highways, railways, and at airports 
in which the methamphetamine shipment originated in the San Diego area. In fact, 
only Los Angeles (78) and San Francisco (22) were identified more often than the 
San Diego area as cities of origin for methamphetamine shipments. Furthermore, 
the amount of methamphetamine seized during those events (29 kg) in 2002 and 
2003 was exceeded only by the amount seized in Los Angeles (259 kg), Phoenix (69 
kg), and the San Francisco area (54 kg). Drug seizure data also show that 
methamphetamine is distributed from the San Diego area to regional and national 
drug markets such as Atlanta, Chicago, Columbus (OH), Dallas, Fort Lauderdale, 
Honolulu, Houston, Meridian (MS), Philadelphia, St. Paul (MN), and Washington, 
D.C.</p>

<p align="left">Reported increases in domestic and foreign production of 
methamphetamine should raise availability levels in domestic markets overall, 
exposing an increasing number of potential new users to the drug and sustaining 
the demand among established methamphetamine users. As a result, the 
consequences of methamphetamine use are likely to continue to rise as more users 
experience the negative health effects brought on by methamphetamine use.</p>
<p align="left">Anecdotal law enforcement reporting, drug survey data, arrest 
data, and laboratory seizure data indicate that methamphetamine availability, 
production, and distribution have increased in the Northeast Region since 2002, 
a situation likely to continue in the near term. Most of the methamphetamine 
distributed in the Northeast currently is produced in laboratories in Mexico or 
California, and increases in availability and distribution likely will be driven 
by increased distribution by Mexican criminal groups that supply local midlevel 
and retail dealers. However, local methamphetamine production in low capacity 
laboratories has been increasing in the Northeast. Small-scale local production 
in the Northeast likely will increase sharply in the near term as 
methamphetamine use in the region increases and established users or initiates 
to methamphetamine use become familiar with production methods and become their 
own sources of supply or even small-scale distributors. According to MTF data, 
past year methamphetamine use in the Northeast Region trended upward from 2002 
to 2003 among eighth (0.8% to 1.7%), tenth (1.5% to 2.1%), and twelfth graders 
(1.6% to 1.8%).</p>
<p align="left">Methamphetamine production in Mexico likely will continue to 
increase. Reported increases in bulk ephedrine and pseudoephedrine shipments 
from China to Mexico for use in Mexico-based superlabs and an apparent decrease 
in the amount of bulk pseudoephedrine diverted from Canada for use in 
California-based superlabs suggest that Mexican criminal groups will concentrate 
more large-scale methamphetamine production efforts in Mexico.</p>
